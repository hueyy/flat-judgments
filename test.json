In the world I come from it is, emphatically, &lt;i&gt;not okay.&lt;/i&gt; We spend huge resources to make sure that files, scripts and apps built in version N work in version N+1 without modification. Even the smallest change in the core engine can break apps. It's just not acceptable. When we make changes we have to be sure there's no breakage. I don't know where these other people come from, or if they make software that anyone uses, but the users I know don't stand for that. As we expose the tradeoffs it becomes clear that &lt;i&gt;that's the issue here.&lt;/i&gt; We are not in Year Zero. There are users. Breaking them is not an option. A conclusion to lift the confusion: Version 0.91 and 0.92 files are valid 2.0 files. This is where we started, what seems like years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;BTW, you can ask anyone who's worked for me in a technical job to explain rules 1 and 1b. (I'll clue you in.

XML-RPC, SOAP, RSS, OPML. Each has been different from the others. In all this work, the most positive experience was XML-RPC, and not just because of the technical excellence of the people involved. In the end, what matters more to me is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=collegiality&quot;&gt;collegiality&lt;/a&gt;. Working together, person to person, for the sheer pleasure of it, is even more satisfying than a good technical result. Now, getting both is the best, and while XML-RPC is not perfect, it's pretty good. I also believe that if you have collegiality, technical excellence follows as a natural outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;One more bit of philosophy. At my checkup earlier this week, one of the things my cardiologist asked was if I was experiencing any kind of intellectual dysfunction. In other words, did I lose any of my sharpness as a result of the surgery in June. I told him yes I had and thanked him for asking. In an amazing bit of synchronicity, the next day John Robb &lt;a href=&quot;http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/25.html#a2598&quot;&gt;located&lt;/a&gt; an article in New Scientist that said that scientists had found a way to prevent this from happening. I hadn't talked with John about my experience or the question the doctor asked. Yesterday I was telling the story to my friend Dave Jacobs. He said it's not a problem because I always had excess capacity in that area. Exactly right Big Dave and thanks for the vote of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;"},"published":"2002-09-29T11:13:10.000Z","publishedRaw":"Sun, 29 Sep 2002 11:13:10 GMT","updated":"2002-09-29T11:13:10.000Z","updatedRaw":"Sun, 29 Sep 2002 11:13:10 GMT","links":[{"href":"http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/29#reallyEarlyMorningNocoffeeNotes"}]}]}
