the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 319 Days from 10 August 2022 to 27 June 2023 for that offence.</p>

The Prosecution submitted that the conduct of the Accused in committing yet another FPUT offence was indicative of his recalcitrance, and that an imprisonment term of not less than 12 months should thus be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     As for the enhanced sentence to be imposed under s 50T Prisons Act 1933 (“Prisons Act”), the Prosecution submitted that the FPUT offence fell at the lower end of the Band 2 of the <em>Abdul Mutalib</em> framework. According to the Prosecution, the offence was of moderate gravity, and the Accused still manifested reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. The Prosecution submitted that similar to the offender in <em>Abdul Mutalib</em>, an enhancement of around 36% of the remaining remission period of 319 days (i.e., 114 days) would be appropriate in the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     The Prosecution also urged the Court to run all sentences consecutively given that the offences were distinct, and the aggregate imprisonment sentence sought was not crushing on the Accused considering his antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     The Accused tendered a written mitigation plea to express his remorse and plead for leniency. He claimed that he had committed the offences because he was going through separation with his foreign wife and this caused him “too much” stress, and he was having a hard time as well due to his medical condition which resulted in him not being able to work. He also pointed out that he had called the police to surrender himself which led to his arrest on 22 September 2022.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     Having considered the facts and parties’ submissions, I agreed in most part with the positions taken by the Prosecution on sentence, for the reasons stated below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Serious Breach of MAC offence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     Under the <em>Abdul Mutalib</em> framework, the sentencing court is to apply a sentencing band approach for offences under ss 50Y and 50T of the Prisons Act. This approach comprises a three-fold classification of “low”, “moderate” and “high”, with each classification tied to the severity of the fresh offence or the serious breach of the MAC. The sentencing court should identify the appropriate degree of severity within a particular sentencing band and arrive at a fraction or percentage of the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the relevant offence. The applicable sentencing bands are as follows:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.16%"/><col width="24.18%"/><col width="51.66%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Band</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Degree of severity</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sentencing range (based on the remaining duration of the remission order)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 1/3</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p> </td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">High</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to full remaining duration</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     The sentencing factors relevant to determining the applicable sentencing band are classified into three categories: (a) factors going towards the gravity of the offence committed by the offender while on remission; (b) factors going towards the offender’s rehabilitative prospects; and (c) all other relevant circumstances. For a s 50Y Prisons Act offence, the factors going towards the gravity of the offence include the “duration of the breach, the consequences of the breach and the motivations behind the breach” (<em>Abdul Mutalib</em> at [56]). As for the factors going towards the offender’s rehabilitative prospects, a key consideration is the timing of the offence, in particular, whether the offender had “committed the offence sooner rather than later after his release on remission” (<em>Abdul Mutalib</em> at [58]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     In the present case, the Accused had failed to return to Selarang Halfway House (“SHWH”) for a total of 181 hours and 26 minutes, despite receiving multiple reminders and warnings to return to SHWH upon the expiry of his curfew period. He had also committed the Serious Breach of MAC offence approximately two and a half months after his release from prison.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     I agreed with the Prosecution that the Serious Breach of MAC offence in the present case can be helpfully contrasted with the equivalent offence committed by the offender in <em>Amanshah.</em> In <em>Amanshah</em>, the offender had breached his curfew for a total of 279 hours and 25 minutes, and had committed the offence just over two months after his release from prison, having failed to return to SHWH despites repeated requests from SHWH’s staff to do so (<em>Abdul Mutalib</em> at [120]). The HC situated the offender’s s 50Y offence at the higher end of Band 2 and held that a sentence of 60% of the remaining remission period would be appropriate (<em>Abdul Mutalib</em> at [121]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     Given that the duration of the Accused’s curfew breach (181 hours and 26 minutes) was much shorter than that of the offender in <em>Amanshah</em> (279 hours and 25 minutes), and he had committed the offence slightly later after his release from prison (2 and a half months) compared to the offender in <em>Amanshah</em> (2 months), I agreed with the Prosecution that the Serious Breach of MAC offence should be situated around the middle of Band 2 of the <em>Abdul Mutalib</em> framework. To his credit, the Accused had voluntarily surrendered himself to the police, which does demonstrate some commitment to rehabilitation (<em>Abdul Mutalib</em> at [91(b)]). However, even though the culpability of the Accused was not as high as the offender in <em>Amanshah</em>, the breach by the Accused was in my view still relatively grave, as he had similarly failed to return to SHWH despite multiple reminders and warnings issued by the relevant officers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     In determining the appropriate percentage of the remaining remission period to be imposed, I also considered two relevant charges which the Accused had consented to be taken into consideration – MAC-908161-2022 and MAC-908162-2022 (see above at [6]). These charges show that the Accused’s breach of the curfew period was not a one-off incident. In the circumstances, I was of the view that it would be just and appropriate to impose a sentence of around 45% of the remaining remission period at the point he had committed the Serious Breach of MAC offence (287 days), which would amount to 129 days’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The FPUT offence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     In relation to the FPUT offence, the Accused had been placed under compulsory supervision after serving his enhanced sentence for drug consumption. The requirement imposed on him to regularly report for urine tests is geared towards ensuring that he “does not relapse to consuming drugs” (<em>Public Prosecutor v Mohamad Hazer Bin Mohamad Hassim</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25339-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 269</a> (“<em>Mohamad Hazer</em>”) at [48]). In sentencing the Accused for the FPUT offence, the primary consideration would be the principle of deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     The Accused’s antecedents for failing to report for urine tests go back to 1997, and he was previously sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for this offence in 1998 and 2003. He is also heavily traced for more serious drug-related offences in the last few years, having served an LT1 sentence for drug consumption in 2016, and an enhanced sentence for another drug consumption offence in 2019. Given his track record, I was of the view that the principle of specific deterrence clearly applied, and a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment for the FPUT offence, which was what he had received when he committed this offence previously, was justified in the circumstances. Unlike in <em>Abdul Mutalib</em> at [102] and <em>Public Prosecutor v Shahradie Bin Bakir</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27740-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 155</a>, I did not think it was necessary to apply the principle of escalation to impose a further uplift on this sentence. This is because the Accused’s previous FPUT offence is relatively dated, and there was no evidence placed before me that he had actually consumed drugs during the period he had committed his present FPUT offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     As for the enhanced sentence to be imposed on the Accused under s 50T Prisons Act, I applied the <em>Abdul Mutalib</em> framework and took into account the following factors:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"/>(a)     The fresh FPUT offence was at the lower end of “moderate” gravity. This is because whilst the underlying sentence imposed (12 months’ imprisonment) is significantly lengthy, the nature of a FPUT offence is on its own of lower gravity compared to other drug offences such as drug possession or drug consumption.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"/>(b)     The Accused had committed the FPUT offence around one and a half months after he was released, and this did not reflect well of his rehabilitative prospects, considering that his original offence was also drug related (i.e., the drug consumption offence in 2019). On the other hand, I considered in his favour: (i) the fact that he had voluntarily surrendered himself to the police (albeit for a separate, later offence), which, as the Prosecution submitted, does demonstrate some reasonable prospects of rehabilitation; and (ii) the absence of evidence placed before the Court that he had actually relapsed into consuming drugs when he committed the FPUT offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     Having weighed the aforementioned factors, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the severity of the Accused’s FPUT offence could be pegged at the lower end of Band 2 of the <em>Abdul Mutalib</em> framework. I therefore imposed an enhanced sentence of 36% of the remaining remission period at the point he had committed the FPUT offence (319 days), which would amount to 114 days’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Last Look at the Aggregate Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     Having determined the individual sentences to be imposed, I ordered all of the sentences to run consecutively. This is because ss 50T(5) and 50Y(5) of the Prisons Act require the sentence for the Serious Breach of MAC offence and the enhanced sentence under s 50T Prisons Act to run consecutively. The underlying FPUT offence should also be run consecutively, as the FPUT offence and the Serious Breach of MAC offence constitute separate and distinct offences which are directed at different legally protected interests (<em>Mohamad Hazer</em> at [48]-[49]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     I also took a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances of the case and came to the view that the aggregate sentence is in line with the principles of totality and proportionality. First, the sentence for the Serious Breach of MAC offence (129 days’ imprisonment) and the enhanced sentence under s 50T Prisons Act which was imposed (114 days’ imprisonment) add up to 243 days, which is a duration that is significantly shorter than the remaining remission period of 319 days at the point of the Accused’s earliest offence (i.e., the FPUT offence). In fact, it is also shorter than the remaining remission period of 287 days at the point of the Accused’s Serious Breach of MAC offence. Second, given the Accused’s age, his list of relevant antecedents and the number of charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing, the aggregate sentence could <em>not</em> be said to be “crushing and not in keeping with the [Accused’s] past record and future prospects” (<em>Abdul Mutalib</em> at [87(d)]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     In conclusion, I was of the view that the aggregate sentence I had imposed on the Accused (i.e., 12 months and 129 days’ imprisonment, with an enhancement of 114 days’ imprisonment) was just and appropriate. It is the hope of the Court that the Accused, who is already 60 years’ old, will seriously reflect on his life during his time in prison, and resolve finally to live a drug and crime free life for his remaining years upon his release.</p> </div></content></root> </div> <form name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm" action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap4 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner" > <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
