defendant is 21 years of age. Over a period of eight months from January to August 2018, when he was 16 years old, he dishonestly induced seven of his friends to deliver to him large sums of money over multiple occasions. He deceived them into believing that he would invest the monies to generate returns for them. He did not invest the monies, but used the monies instead to buy in-game items for online games, and for online gambling with the in-game items. By his deception, he cheated his friends of more than $332,000 in total. About $83,000 was given back as purported “investment returns”; but close to $249,000 remains unrecovered and unrepaid.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       Seven charges of cheating were brought against the defendant, under s 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition) (“<b>Penal Code</b>”). On 16 August 2022 he pleaded guilty to three charges, with the remaining four charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Pre-sentence reports were called to assess his suitability for probation and reformative training (“<b>RT</b>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       He was recommended both for probation and RT. On account of rehabilitation being the dominant sentencing consideration given his young age, coupled with the need for deterrence, he was sentenced to undergo RT (with a minimum period of detention of 6 months) on 20 October 2022. The sentence was deferred to 3 November 2022 to allow time for him to settle his personal matters. He filed the present appeal against the sentence on 1 November 2022. The execution of the sentence has been stayed and he is on bail pending the appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plea of Guilt</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proceeded charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       The defendant pleaded guilty to the following three charges under s 420 of the Penal Code, each of which was an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2012 Revised Edition) (“<b>CPC</b>”):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">DAC-907396-2022 (1st charge)</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You […] are charged that you, sometime between around 8 May 2018 and 11 August 2018, in Singapore, did cheat [Victim 1 (“<b>V1</b>”)], to wit, by deceiving him into believing that you will use the monies obtained from him for investments to generate returns for him, which is a fact you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced [V1] to deliver to you S$106,050 over at least 26 occasions, all of which taken together amount to a course of conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition), which charge is amalgamated under Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2012 Revised Edition).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">DAC-907397-2022 (2nd charge)</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You […] are charged that you, sometime between around January 2018 and 18 August 2018, in Singapore, did cheat [Victim 2 (“<b>V2</b>”)], to wit, by deceiving him into believing that you will use the monies obtained from him for investments to generate returns for him, which is a fact you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced [V2] to deliver to you S$188,847 over at least 35 occasions, all of which taken together amount to a course of conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition), which charge is amalgamated under Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2012 Revised Edition).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">DAC-907401-2022 (6th charge)</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You […] are charged that you, sometime between around 30 June 2018 and 14 August 2018, in Singapore, did cheat [Victim 6 (“<b>V6</b>”)], to wit, by deceiving him into believing that you will use the monies obtained from him for investments to generate returns for him, which is a fact you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced [V6] to deliver to you S$5,000 over at least 3 occasions, all of which taken together amount to a course of conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition), which charge is amalgamated under Section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68, 2012 Revised Edition).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       The salient facts were as follows.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Background</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       Sometime prior to November 2017, the defendant discovered that he was able to make a profit from the sale and purchase of in-game items from online games such as <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. Around November 2017, he decided to increase his profits from the sale and purchase of these in-game items by purchasing more expensive in-game items and subsequently selling them for a higher profit margin.

The defendant had perpetrated an investment scam. The year-on-year increase in the number of scams in Singapore underscored the need for general deterrence. Specific deterrence was also a relevant sentencing principle. The defendant had deceived a total of seven victims to deliver monies over 84 occasions. Given the multiple offences committed, he could not be considered a first-time offender but was a recalcitrant offender for which specific deterrence was warranted. Large sums of money were involved. The total amount cheated from the seven victims was $332,067. Although $82,943 was given back to the victims as returns on investment and mitigated the economic harm sustained by the victims, it was not as restitution and could not be considered a demonstration of the defendant’s remorse. In any event, a substantial sum of $249,124 remained outstanding.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence’s submissions </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     Counsel for the defendant submitted that a probation order was appropriate given the circumstances of the offences and the defendant’s young age.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Rehabilitation ought to be the dominant sentencing consideration, given his good temperament, remorse and good home environment. He had no antecedents. He was only 16 years’ old at the time of the offences. He was foolish and committed the offences in a misguided attempt to gain the favour of his friends. This was an act of folly and not a representation of his character. He had cooperated fully with the authorities: he was first called up by the police for investigations around four years ago, and had cooperated with the investigations since then. He was genuinely remorseful for his actions. He had also been enlisted for National Service, and had learnt to be more disciplined through his time in National Service. He was committed to becoming a better person, and had taken proactive steps to better himself, and to find ways to make better use of his time by giving back to society. The risk of re-offending was low.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing considerations</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Framework for sentencing of youthful offenders</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     The sentencing of youthful offenders involves two distinct but related stages, as explained by the High Court in <em>PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> at [28]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is well established that when a court sentences a youthful offender, it approaches the task in two distinct but related stages (<em>PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')"><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a></a> […] at [77]–[78]). At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     The two stages of the sentencing process are:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"/>(a)     Stage 1: to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"/>(b)     Stage 2: to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet the sentencing considerations.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Primary sentencing considerations: rehabilitation, deterrence, retribution</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     I accepted that <em>rehabilitation</em> was a dominant sentencing consideration given the defendant’s young age when he committed the offences, and that he had no antecedents. That said, the offences were serious in nature and caused substantial harm to the victims. Over a period of about eight months between January and August 2018, he deceived seven of his friends into handing over large sums of money, totalling more than $332,000 over at least 84 occasions. These were not one-off offences, but involved conduct that was persistent and premeditated. The victims suffered very heavy losses for which they have not been compensated, and a large amount of more than $249,000 remained outstanding. Accordingly, <em>deterrence</em> and <em>retribution</em> were relevant considerations that ought to be factored into the sentencing decision as well. The offences were not so heinous, however, that rehabilitation was completely displaced as a sentencing consideration. I therefore accepted the submission of the prosecution that it would be appropriate to call for pre-sentence reports for both probation and RT. Both reports were called for at the plead-guilty mention on 16 August 2022, and the case was adjourned for sentencing on a later date pending the pre-sentence reports.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     The defendant was recommended for probation and also found suitable for RT:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"/>(a)     In the <em>Probation Officer’s Report</em> dated 23 September 2022 (the “<b>Probation Report</b>”), the defendant was recommended for probation. It was recommended that he undergo supervised probation for 21 months with the following conditions: a time restriction of 10 pm to 6 am, to perform 80 hours of community service, and for his parents to be bonded to ensure his good behaviour.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"/>(b)     In the <em>Pre-Sentencing Report for Reformative Training</em> dated 19 September 2022 (the “<b>RT Report</b>”), the defendant was found to be physically and mentally fit to undergo the RT regime. It was stated that: “[the defendant] would benefit from intervention targeting his poor decision making and problem-solving skills. He would also benefit from follow up in the community to support and maintain his abstinence from gambling.” The recommendation was that the defendant undergo “Level 1 intensity of rehabilitation” if sentenced to RT.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Appropriate sentence: reformative training</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     The prosecution submitted that the defendant should be ordered to undergo RT at level 1 intensity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> While the dominant sentencing consideration was rehabilitation as the defendant was a young offender below the age of 21, RT was more suitable as there was an enhanced need for deterrence. There had been a disturbing rise in scams, including investment scams, and underscored the need for general deterrence. The present case involved a series of investment scams perpetuated on seven victims, involving staggering sums totalling $332,067. There was also a need for specific deterrence. The defendant’s offending was persistent and premeditated, and the victims were cheated over an extended period of time and deceived into delivering monies numerous times. Although the defendant was untraced, he could not be treated as a first-time offender. The sum of $82,943 given back to some of the victims as purported returns on their purported investments must be accorded minimal mitigatory weight as it did not represent true restitution or an act of remorse. In any event, the outstanding loss to the seven victims was $249,124. Both the degree of harm caused by the defendant and the degree of his criminal benefit were high. There was thus a need for deterrence with an overarching focus and emphasis of rehabilitation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     The defence submitted that probation would best fulfil the aims of the defendant’s rehabilitation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Given his personal circumstances and environment, RT would be disruptive and detrimental to his rehabilitation. A sentence of RT would result in a criminal record, which would be a blemish on his future. The favourable conditions for rehabilitation outside institutionalised custody made RT a disproportionately harsh sentence. The defendant was not a hardened criminal. RT would increase the risk of him being exposed to bad influences, and would remove him from his present social environment, which was conducive to his rehabilitation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     In deciding on the appropriate sentence, I accepted that rehabilitation was a dominant sentencing consideration given the defendant’s young age. (This was a point that was not in dispute.) The offences were committed in 2018 when he was about 16 years old, and he had not reoffended. I was prepared to accept the submission of the defence that there had been positive changes in the defendant’s life, and his rehabilitative prospects were good.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> This was borne out by the positive recommendation in the Probation Report, and also from the fact that the RT Report recommended that a level 1 intensity of rehabilitation would suffice (rather than a level 2 intensity). Had rehabilitation been the sole sentencing consideration, I would have had no hesitation in making a probation order as suggested by counsel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     However, I also considered deterrence and retribution to be relevant sentencing considerations (above, at [23]). In my judgment, an order of probation would not adequately address the need for deterrence and retribution. The deterrent effect of a probation order would be “penumbral at best”: <em>PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')"><a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a></a> (“<b><em>Al-Ansari</em></b>”) at [55]. It would also not be a <em>just desert</em> for the wrong that had been done. The sentencing option that would better meet the rehabilitative needs of the defendant as an individual, while fulfilling the public interest demands of deterrence and retribution, would be reformative training.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     As was explained in <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [58], RT would provide “a middle ground that broadly encapsulates the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence in relation to young offenders”. In the course of seeking the right balance between rehabilitation and deterrence, “rehabilitation as a dominant consideration does not inevitably mean probation orders”: <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [63]. It was further explained in <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [65]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Apart from probation orders, reformative training functions equally well to advance the dominant principle of rehabilitation, and may even represent a better balance between the need for rehabilitation and deterrence. […]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     The defence raised a concern that a sentence of RT would be disruptive and detrimental to the defendant’s rehabilitation, and increase the risk of his being exposed to bad influences. While such risks have been recognised, for example in <em>PP v Justin Heng Zheng Hao</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0219.xml')">[2012] SGDC 219</a> at [27] and <em>Praveen s/o Krishnan v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21718-SSP.xml')">[2018] 3 SLR 1300</a> at [63], it cannot preclude the court from imposing such a sentence where it was warranted by the gravity of the offending conduct and the harm caused, as in the present case. It has been observed that “reformative training allows the courts to sentence the offender to a rehabilitative programme under a structured environment while avoiding the danger of exposing the young offender to the potentially unsettling influence of an adult prison environment” and RT is “the preferred sentencing option in cases where a degree of deterrence is desired”: <em>PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> at [38], [39]; see also <em>PP v Ong Jack Hong</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19524-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 166</a> at [14].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     I accepted the recommendation in the RT Report that a level 1 intensity of rehabilitation would be appropriate. I was satisfied, having regard to the defendant’s character (which was amenable to rehabilitation) and the circumstances of the offences (which were serious and caused substantial harm), that to reform him and to prevent him from committing further crime, he should undergo RT. The preconditions for a sentence of RT, under s 305 of the CPC, had been met. I did not accept the submission of the defence that RT would be a disproportionately harsh sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     Accordingly, the defendant was sentenced to RT with a minimum period of detention of 6 months, in accordance with the recommendations in the RT Report. The execution of the sentence has been stayed pending the appeal, and the defendant is on bail pending the appeal.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Statement of Facts dated 15 August 2022.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Prosecution’s Sentencing Position dated 11 August 2022.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Plea in Mitigation dated 15 August 2022.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Prosecution’s Skeletal Sentencing Submissions dated 26 September 2022.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Defence’s Further Submissions dated 6 October 2022.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Defence’s Further Submissions dated 6 October 2022 at [9].</p></div></content></root> </div> <form name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm" action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap9 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner" > <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
