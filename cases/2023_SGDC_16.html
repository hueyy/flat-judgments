Accused, Ow Gan Wee (male of 50 years of age)(“the Accused”), pleaded guilty before me to the following three charges:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>DAC 908778-2022</u>-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Possession of a Class A controlled drug, i.e. one straw of granular/powdery substance containing not less than 0.03 gram of diamorphine committed on 28 February 2022 at the Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”) at 391, New Bridge Road, Singapore. This is an offence under section 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (“MDA”).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the Accused was previously convicted of the same offence under section 8(a) of the MDA on 16 July 1999 and was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, he was liable for enhanced punishment for the present offence under section 33(1) of the MDA of a minimum of two years’ imprisonment (hereinafter referred to as the “MDA charge”);</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>DAC 916897-2022</u>-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Theft of a cash card containing stored value of about $11 and cash of about $500 to $600 in the possession of one Fu Tingwan (“1<sup>st</sup> victim”) on 16 November 2021 along the road next to No.1, Jalan Berseh, New World Centre, Singapore, an offence under section 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed)(“the first theft charge”); and</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>DAC 916896-2022</u>-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Theft of cash amounting to $526 belonging to one Siah Wee Seng (“2<sup>nd</sup> victim”) on 23 June 2022 at a bus terminal at Block 206, Hougang Street 21, Singapore, an offence under section 379 of the Penal Code 1871(“the second theft charge”)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       A total of five remaining charges, comprising three theft charges under section 379 of the Penal Code 1871<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, one charge of drug consumption of morphine, a specified drug under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, with enhanced punishment under section 33(3A) of the MDA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and one charge of possession of a utensil which was intended to be used for consumption of drug, an offence under section 9 of the MDA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, with the consent of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       After hearing the sentencing submissions from both the prosecution and defence, and having considered the Accused’s antecedents, I called for suitability reports on the Accused to undergo both corrective training (“CT”) and preventive detention (“PD”) to be prepared. Both reports certified that the Accused was fit to undergo the sentences of CT and PD.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       Having considered all relevant sentencing considerations, I sentenced the Accused to eight years of PD.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       Being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, the Accused has appealed against the same.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statement of Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       The Accused admitted to the following statement of facts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> without any qualification:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The First Theft Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       On 16 November 2021 at about 2.45 pm, the 1<sup>st</sup> victim’s supervisor called the police and reported that while the 1<sup>st</sup> victim was unloading goods to send to a customer’s place, his cashcard and wallet were stolen from his lorry. The location given was No.1, Jalan Berseh, New World Centre, Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       Investigations revealed that sometime before 2 pm on that day, the 1<sup>st</sup> victim drove his company’s lorry and parked it along the road next to No.1, Jalan Berseh, New World Centre. As he needed to deliver some goods in the vicinity, he left his sling bag containing his wallet on the passenger seat of the lorry. He then left the lorry unlocked and went to deliver the goods.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       At about 2 pm, the Accused saw the lorry and decided to steal from it. When he realised that the lorry was unlocked, he entered the lorry and rummaged through the sling bag. He found the 1<sup>st</sup> victim’s wallet inside and stole cash of about $500 to $600 from it. The Accused also took the cashcard from the in-vehicle unit of the lorry which had about $11 in stored value. He then left the lorry.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     The Accused had used the cash and the cashcard to buy cigarettes and for his personal expenses. Thereafter, he threw the cashcard away.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     When the 1<sup>st</sup> victim returned to the lorry and discovered that the cash in his wallet and the cashcard were missing, he informed his supervisor who then called the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     Pursuant to the call to the police, the police reviewed the CCTV footage in the vicinity and established that the Accused had boarded a taxi. Based on screening done with the relevant taxi company, the police established the location where the Accused was dropped off. Further review of the CCTV footage of that location led the police to confirm the Accused’s identity. He was subsequently arrested on 19 November 2021 at his residence at Block 524, Hougang Avenue 6, #XXX.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     No restitution was made by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The MDA Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     On 28 February 2022 at about 1.30 pm, the Accused was arrested at the PCC at 391, New Bridge Road, Singapore on suspicion that he had committed drug related offences. A search was conducted on the Accused and the following items were seized from him:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"/>(a)     One straw containing granular/powdery substance (“A1”);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"/>(b)     One burnt aluminium foil.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     A1 was subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. On 29 March 2022, Dr Wong Zheng-Zing Jonathan, an analyst of the HSA, issued a certificate under Section 16 of the MDA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>, stating that on analysis, A1 was found to weigh not less than 0.03 gram of granular/powdery substance, which was analysed and found to contain diamorphine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     The Accused had in his possession A1 for his personal consumption. He knew that A1 contained diamorphine. The Accused admitted that he had been consuming “<em>bai fen</em>” (Chinese street name for diamorphine) since January 2022. He last consumed diamorphine prior to his arrest, in the toilet of his residence. He said that he consumed diamorphine as he was stressed by his financial situation. He consumed diamorphine about one to two times a month. He bought his supply of diamorphine from an unknown person in Geylang, for about $30 per straw.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     Diamorphine is a class A controlled drug listed in the first schedule to the MDA. The Accused was not authorised to possess diamorphine under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder. He had thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Second Theft Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     On 23 June 2022 at about 2.45 pm, the 2<sup>nd</sup> victim called the police and reported that someone stole money from his shop, and that person was still around. The location given was at a fruit stall located a bus terminal at Block 206, Hougang Street 21, Singapore (“the fruit stall”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     Investigations revealed that on that day at about 2.34pm, the Accused walked past the fruit stall and bought some fruits. He saw that a metal container containing cash was placed on a table in the fruit stall. He decided to steal some money for his personal expenses. After buying some fruits, he looked around to check that the employees of the fruit stall were not looking at him. He then took a stack of cash from the metal container and put the money in his pocket. He stole about $526, comprising:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"/>(a)     Ten pieces of $50 note;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"/>(b)     One piece of $10 note;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"/>(c)     Two pieces of $5 note; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"/>(d)     Three pieces of $2 note.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     A passer-by witnessed the Accused stealing the money and alerted the employees of the fruit stall. A few employees then went after the Accused and stopped him from leaving. They also contacted the 2<sup>nd</sup> victim who quickly came back to the stall and called the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     The police arrived at the scene and arrested the Accused.

sentences should be ordered to run consecutively, making it a total of five years’ imprisonment, which is the same duration as the minimum duration of five years for a sentence of CT. Hence, under the third step in stage two of the framework, a sentence of CT could not be said to be unduly disproportionate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     The prosecution therefore urged the Court to call for suitability report for both CT and PD.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     Mr Gregory Fong of M/s Fong &amp; Fong LLC was assigned to act for the Accused under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”). In a written plea in mitigation<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, Mr Fong stated that after his latest stint of CT imposed in 2013, the Accused found it difficult to adjust and reconnect with society.

However, he was again sentenced to two years imprisonment in 1999 for the same offence. A plausible explanation for this could be due to the application of the totality principle by the sentencing court in 1999. This was because the two years’ imprisonment term was ordered to run consecutively with the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment term for the offence of drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA. Hence, in order that the total sentence was not crushing on the Accused, the sentencing court could very well have decided not to apply the escalation principle in the sentence on the unauthorised possession of controlled drug charge in 1999, and again imposed a sentence of two years’ imprisonment. Hence, for the purpose of arriving at the imprisonment term that would likely be imposed on the Accused for this charge under step one in stage two of the framework, the likely sentence could very well have been four years’ imprisonment. This would have resulted in the total sentence that was likely to be imposed on the Accused to be up to six years’ imprisonment, well above the minimum sentence of five years for CT.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     Hence, I called for suitability reports for both CT and PD to be prepared for the Accused, since he had already undergone two stints of CT and yet was still re-offending after his release.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Reports</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     Both reports<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> found the Accused to be generally in good physical condition with no known major illnesses.

His narrative of his offences suggested a pattern of justifications for his theft offences, using his financial constraints as justification for his theft offences. He viewed himself as a victim of the circumstances that he faced.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     The reports placed the Accused in the “high risk/need” level of criminal re-offending and that he belonged to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recividism within two years of release. This appeared to be contributed by his limited social support and poor financial means due to unstable employment. It was further exacerbated by his familiarity with using anti-social methods for financial gains, his drug use and unhealthy thinking patterns.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the reports noted the “protective factors” in favour of the Accused in that he had stable positive familial support.

Further, prosecution pointed to the CT and PD reports wherein the Accused felt that his offences were “relatively minor” and provided justifications for his behaviour. This resulted in the Accused having a high risk of reoffending.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     Under step three in the second stage of the framework, on whether a sentence of CT/PD would be unduly disproportionate, the prosecution submitted that since the likely imprisonment terms which the Accused would be given for the present offences was eight years, as highlighted in [38] above, a sentence of CT/PD would not be unduly disproportionate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     The prosecution further submitted that since the Accused had already been sentenced previously to two stints of CT but continued to reoffend, “it would be expedient for the protection of the public”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> that a sentence of eight years’ PD be imposed on the Accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defence’s Further Submissions on Sentence (Post Reports) </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     Mr Fong submitted that as the amounts involved in the two s 379 charges were small, a sentence of eight years’ PD would be crushing on the Accused.

Under step one in stage two of the framework, i.e. the likely imprisonment term that would be imposed for the underlying offences, I was of the view that the likely imprisonment terms are as follows:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.6659331866373%"/><col width="40.7881576315263%"/><col width="29.5459091818364%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Charge</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Previous sentence imposed for the immediate past conviction</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Likely Sentence</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The MDA charge (possession of controlled drug)</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 years’ imprisonment</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 years’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">First theft charge</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 years’ corrective training</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 years’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Second theft charge</p> </td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 years’ corrective training</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 years’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     For the reasons as explained in [31] above, I was of the view that a four-year imprisonment term would be the likely sentence for the s 8(a) charge under the MDA. Further, the Accused also admitted and consented to two other charges under the MDA being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     As for the theft charges, since these were his sixth convictions for such offence (see the table of the Accused’s antecedents in [22] above), and he also had three other theft charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, a sentence of two years’ imprisonment for each charge would be the likely sentence to be imposed on the Accused and cannot be said to be manifestly excessive. This is slightly lower than the two and a half years’ imprisonment suggested by the prosecution, as I found that the values of the items stolen in the present theft charges were not high and similar to that in his 2006 and 2013 convictions (see [36] above).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     As all three offences took place at different periods of time, with the second theft charge having been committed on 23 June 2022 (see [18] above) while the Accused had already been charged in court for his earlier offences and was released on bail <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> pending the completion of investigations, it would be appropriate to order all three sentences to run consecutively, making it a total of eight years’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     Under step two in stage two of the framework, the fact that the Accused was eligible for MAS (see [39] above) was a neutral factor. This is because the High Court in <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> (at [3] and [17]) found that in view of two major changes made in 2014 to the regular imprisonment terms, namely, the implementation of the MAS and the Conditional Remission Scheme (“the CRS”), in the present operating environment, there were no “<em>qualitative</em>” differences between the rehabilitative programmes available to inmates serving regular imprisonment term and those available to CT inmates. In other words, offenders sentenced to CT (and therefore PD as well) would also be eligible for the same rehabilitative programmes available to inmates serving regular imprisonment term.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     Under step three in stage two of the framework, in view of my findings in [44] to [46] above that the likely global imprisonment term that would be imposed on the Accused was eight years’ imprisonment, a sentence of CT/PD <em>would not</em> be unduly disproportionate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     Both the CT and PD reports found that the Accused was suitable to undergo CT and PD. The reports also placed the Accused in the “high risk/need” level of criminal re-offending, and that he belonged to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recividism within two years of release (see [33] to [35] above). These factors, coupled with the Accused’s long list of antecedents as set out in [22] above, far outweighed the “protective factors” in favour of the Accused as noted by the reports as set out in [35] above. Hence, I agreed with the prosecution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> that since the Accused had already been sentenced previously to two stints of CT but had continued to reoffend, it would be expedient for the protection of the public that a sentence of PD be imposed on the Accused, in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment. In the circumstances, I sentenced the Accused to eight years of PD, the same duration as the likely global imprisonment term that would be imposed on the Accused as stated in [46] above.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     The High Court in <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> also held at [121] that once it was accepted that there was no longer any “qualitative” difference between CT (and PD) and regular imprisonment, there can be no justification for not backdating the commencement date of a CT (and PD) sentence to take into account the time spent in remand. I therefore backdated the PD sentence to 24 June 2022, the date from which the Accused was remanded when his bail was revoked.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     The Accused, being dissatisfied with the above sentence, has since appealed against the same. He is currently serving the sentence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>MACs 901975, 903438 and 904439 of 2022</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>DAC 908777 of 2022</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>DAC 908779 of 2022</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>PS1</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Lab Number 2203303-ID-001</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>Antecedent Report (A) and Memorandum of certified previous convictions (B)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraphs 3 and 4, Prosecution’s Preliminary Sentencing Position (“C”)</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>D1</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 3 of D1</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraph 4 of D1</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence (NE), Day 1 at page 3 ln 18 to page 4 ln 5 and page 15 ln 12 to page 16 ln 14.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 5 and 6 of D1</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_13_1" id="Ftn_13">[note: 13]</a></sup>Marked “CT” and “PD” respectively.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_14_1" id="Ftn_14">[note: 14]</a></sup>Page 2 and 3 of both reports.
