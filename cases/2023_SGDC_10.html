Ah Xiang asked Zhang if he would use his bank account to receive and transfer out funds to other bank accounts. Zhang was told that the funds to be received and transferred would amount to tens of thousands each day.

Each of them faced charges for conspiring to transfer a total of $912,129.70 in criminal proceeds, which they first received in the bank accounts and then transferred to foreign bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"/>(b)     There was a transnational element involved in the offences, given the transfer of the criminal proceeds to foreign bank accounts.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"/>(c)     Premeditation and sophistication in the criminal enterprise, which involved using the bank accounts of foreign nationals who were leaving Singapore to receive criminal proceedings.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"/>(d)     The accused persons offended over a significant period of time from 3 May 2021 to 20 June 2021, stopping only when they were arrested on 20 June 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"/>(e)     The accused persons were motivated by the prospect of large rewards. Zhang received $200 in commission for every $10,000 that was received, which he shared equally with Yin. For the $912,129.70 that was received in total by the accused person, they would thus have received $18,242.60 in commission.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_f"/>(f)     The accused persons each face three TIC charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     The Prosecution noted that the accused persons had not made any restitution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     The Prosecution cited precedent cases involving offences under section 47 of the CDSA. The offenders in those cases were sentenced to varying imprisonment terms. The table setting out the details of the precedents that the Prosecution tendered to Court is at Annex A.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s sentencing submission and mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     The Defence sought a global sentence of 18 to 24 months’ imprisonment against each accused person. In their submissions, they urged the Court to consider the following factors, which were also based on the sentencing factors set out by the High Court in <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"/>(a)     While the total amount involved across all the CDSA charges was $912,129.70, the amount involved in the proceeded charges was $602,461.70 and the 2 charges that the Prosecution was seeking consecutive sentences on involved $498,558.00. The Defence argued that the Court ought to primarily focus on the proceeded charges for the purposes of sentencing, and then look at the amount in the TIC charges after that.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"/>(b)     The accused persons had no knowledge as to the offence-specific factors going towards harm as set out in <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em>, such as involvement of a syndicate, seriousness of the predicate offence and harm done to the confidence in public administration, as the accused persons were involved into the receiving and transferring of the monies and knew nothing else.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"/>(c)     The collecting of ATM cards and bank account details from foreigners was not a sophisticated scheme that involved a high degree of planning and premeditation.

The Defence similarly proceeded with their submissions on the basis that both accused persons should receive the same sentences and did not seek to distinguish their roles or culpability in any way. Based on the Statement of Facts, while it was Zhang who spoke with Ah Xiang at the outset, he subsequently discussed the plan with Yin and they both agreed to accept Ah Xiang’s offer and proceeded with the plan. As such, I did not see any basis to distinguish their roles in a manner that would warrant different sentences to be imposed on each of them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that general deterrence is the dominant sentencing consideration for cases involving offences under the CDSA. As the High Court in <em>Ang Jeanette v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 0001.xml')">[2011] 4 SLR 1</a> noted at [73], there is a strong need to deter would-be money launders particularly given Singapore’s standing as a major international financial centre in the region.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     Both parties cited the case of <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em> as a case from which sentencing guidance for this present case can be derived. While <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em> concerned offences under section 44(1)(a) of the CDSA, which is for assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct, parties were of the view that the sentencing factors for a section 44(1)(a) offence as set out by the High Court can be applied to offences under section 47(2)(b) of the CDSA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     I agreed with parties that the sentencing considerations set out in <em>Huang Ying-Chun</em> are a helpful reference for the sentencing of offences under section 47(2)(b) of the CDSA given that both offences involve the facilitation of the benefits of a third-party’s criminal conduct. Using these sentencing considerations as a reference, I considered the following factors in determining the appropriate sentences to be imposed:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>The amount involved.</u> One of the primary aggravating factors in this case was the substantial amount of funds involved in the charges. $912,129.70 is a very significant amount of money. On the proceeded charges alone, the amount involved stands at S$602,461.70.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Transnational element.</u> There was clearly a transnational element to the offences, given that the accused persons transferred the funds received to foreign bank accounts.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"/>(c)      <u>Degree of planning and premeditation, and the level of sophistication of the scheme.</u> I agreed with the Prosecution that the offences were clearly premeditated and involved a level of sophistication. In my view, the Defence’s position that this was a scheme that “<em>practically anyone could have thought of</em>” unfairly downplayed the nature of the scheme. The plan to use the bank accounts of foreign nationals who were leaving Singapore was one designed to mitigate the risk of detection, which Zhang was clearly alive to.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"/>(d)      <u>Duration of offending.</u> The offences were committed over a period of 49 days. The Defence argued that this was not a long period of time, as the Prosecution had characterised it. 49 days is indeed not a very long period, but it is clear on this fact that the accused persons had not engaged in a one-off or even brief bout of criminal activity. They were persistent and prolific in their criminal conduct in this period, receiving $912,129.70 in the bank accounts that they controlled over this period of 49 days, stopping only after they were arrested at the roadblock.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"/>(e)      <u>The offender’s knowledge of the underlying predicate offence.</u> The Defence sought to emphasise that the accused persons were not aware of that the funds were proceeds of cheating offences but instead proceeds from illegal online gambling. I agreed with the Defence that there is indeed room to distinguish between an offender who has direct knowledge of the underlying criminal conduct and one who only had reasonable grounds to believe that he was facilitating a third party’s benefits of criminal conduct. That said, even by the accused persons own account, they were never under any illusion (however flimsy) that they were dealing were untainted funds, since they were under the impression that these were the proceeds from illegal online gambling.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_f"/>(f)      <u>The prospect of reward.</u> Both accused persons had engaged in this criminal enterprise in anticipation of the financial benefits that they would obtain in the form of commissions, which would have amounted to a significant amount based on the agreed rate of $200 per $10,000 received in the bank accounts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     Turning to the offender-specific factors, I had regard to the fact that the accused persons had elected to plead guilty to the charges, which I accepted should be accorded mitigating weight.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     At the hearing, Defence Counsel informed me that the accused persons did not intend to lay claim to the sum of $406,850 that had been seized from them, which formed the subject matter of the TIC charges under section 35 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act. Defence Counsel argued that this amount of money ought to be considered as partial recovery of the funds involved in the case that could be returned to victims.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     I did not think that much credit could be given for the $406,850 that the accused persons were intending not to lay claim to. This amount was seized from the accused persons when they were caught at a police roadblock, as opposed to having been voluntarily surrendered or paid in restitution. In fact, as the charges against the accused persons make plain, the accused persons were not able to give a satisfactory explanation of why this amount of cash was found in their possession. As the Prosecution pointed out, the sum of $912,129.70 that formed the subject matter of the CDSA charges had been transferred into the foreign bank accounts by the accused persons and did not overlap with the $406,850 in cash that was seized from the accused persons.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentences imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     In determining the sentences to be imposed on the accused persons, I considered the precedents that parties had referred to in submissions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     Both parties referred to the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Bahurudeen Kuthpudeen</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22267-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 260</a> as a useful reference point for the third proceeded charges against the accused persons, <em>i.e.</em> the charges involving the amount of $437,558. In that case, an individual sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment was imposed for a charge under section 47(1)(b) of the CDSA involving a sum of $469,900.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     The charge in <em>Bahurudeen</em> involved the removal of the offender’s proceeds of his own offence under section 408 of the Penal Code, which meant that the offender did have direct knowledge of the underlying predicate offence. I accept that this can be distinguished from a situation where the offenders do not have direct knowledge of the underlying predicate offence. However, I note that while the accused persons in this case did not have direct knowledge of the underlying predicate offence, this was not a case where they had been given some flimsy cover story with red flags that they ignored – they were never under any illusion that these were untainted funds. As Defence Counsel emphasised several times during the hearing, the accused persons had acted under the impression that they were dealing in the proceeds of illegal online gambling.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     I also noted that the offender in <em>Bahurudeen</em> engaged in a single act of removing his proceeds of crime from Singapore by carrying a sum of cash with him as he left Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint. In comparison, the third proceeded charges against the accused persons were amalgamated charges that covered conduct over a period of 10 days. The means by which the funds were transferred were also more complex than that in <em>Bahurudeen</em>. There was also the fact that the accused persons in this case faced additional TIC charges for similar offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     On a balance of these factors, in my view, the conduct of the accused persons on this charge was more aggravated than that of the offender in <em>Bahurudeen</em> and so while the amounts involved in the third proceeded charges and <em>Bahurudeen</em> were similar, I was of the view that a higher sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment against each accused person was appropriate on the third proceeded charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     As for the first and second proceeded charges involving the sums of $61,000 and $103,903.70, I sentenced the accused persons to 5 months’ imprisonment and 9 months’ imprisonment respectively. In doing so, I had regard to the precedents cited by the Prosecution, <em>Public Prosecutor v Ng Koon Lay</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24910-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 196</a> and <em>Public Prosecutor v Zulkiffili Bin Radi</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18963-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGDC 145</a>, where the offenders faced charges under section 47(2)(b) of the CDSA involving similar amounts as the first and second proceeded charges.

The accused provided her UOB bank account details to Greg. Thereafter, a sum of $71,000 was received in the UOB account. The accused transferred $62,000 to another bank account as instructed and kept $9,000 for herself. On 23 September 2016, the accused was warned by CAD not to receive any more monies in her bank account as her bank account was being used to receive illegal funds. Despite this warning, on 29 September 2016, the accused received another US$88,000 (S$118,360) from Greg in her Citibank account (subject to the s. 411 PC charge).
