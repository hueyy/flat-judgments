Shalom Israel (Asia-Pacific) Ltd (“the Plaintiff Company”), has brought two suits:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"/>(a)     DC/DC 1572/2020 (“DC 1572”), against a tour company called Travel 360 Pte Ltd (“Travel 360").</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"/>(b)     DC/DC 1939/2021 (“DC 1939”), against three individuals whom I will collectively refer to as “the Tan Family”: Jenny Chaw Chong Eng, her husband Tan Seck Chee and their daughter Wendy Tan Hwai Ling.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>I will collectively refer to the defendants in both suits, <em>ie</em> Travel 360 and the Tan Family, as “the Defendants”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       The Defendants have filed the following specific discovery applications against the Plaintiff Company:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"/>(a)     DC/SUM 2447/2022 (in DC 1572); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"/>(b)     DC/SUM 2446/2022 (in DC 1939).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       Each application sought the same five categories of documents, itemised as categories (A) to (E). For both suits, the learned Deputy Registrar (“DR”) below granted the applications in respect of the first three categories of documents sought by the Defendants, <em>ie</em>, categories (A) to (C), but denied the applications in respect of the documents in categories (D) and (E).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       The Defendants filed an appeal in each suit against the dismissal of their applications in respect of category (D). I allow the appeals and order the Plaintiff Company to provide discovery of the items in category (D). However, as I will explain below, I have narrowed the timeframe for the dates of the documents to be discovered.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural Background</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       The Plaintiff Company is in the business of organising Christian activities, including tours to the Middle East. Its directors are two pastors, one of whom is Pastor George Annadorai (“Pastor George”).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The pleaded cases for the two suits</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       The gist of the Plaintiff Company’s claims in both suits, to the extent relevant to the appeals before me, is set out below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       DC 1572 was the Plaintiff Company’s suit against Travel 360. By way of background, Travel 360 was connected to the Tan Family as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"/>(a)     Jenny Chew was Travel 360’s Chief Operating Officer;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"/>(b)     Tan Seck Chee was Travel 360’s secretary; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"/>(c)     Wendy Lee was, according to the Statement of Claim (“SoC”), Travel 360’s logistics manager.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>The Plaintiff Company claimed that it had engaged Travel 360 to organise tours to Israel and Turkey. Under the terms of the engagement, Travel 360 was supposed to, <em>inter alia</em>, pay external vendors for the expenditure incurred in respect of the tours, as well as pay donations to various beneficiaries. However, Travel 360 did not have the funds to make these payments. The Plaintiff Company thus made the payments first, on the understanding that it would be reimbursed by Travel 360. To this end, between 6 December 2018 and 19 February 2019 (both days inclusive), the Plaintiff Company made the payments to various vendors / beneficiaries. However, Travel 360 allegedly subsequently failed to fully reimburse the Plaintiff Company for these payments, making only a small part-payment. The Plaintiff Company thus sued Travel 360 to, <em>inter alia</em>, recover the balance due.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       DC 1939 was the Plaintiff Company’s suit against all three members of the Tan Family personally. This suit was brought in relation to the Plaintiff Company’s dealings with another tour company, called Raffles Air Pte Ltd (“Raffles Air”). According to the SoC, Jenny Chaw was Raffles Air’s General Manager, while Tan Seck Chee and Wendy Tan were Raffles Air’s directors. The Plaintiff Company claimed that it had engaged Raffles Air to organise a tour to Israel. The tour itinerary included an item called the Holocaust Event, the logistics for which were to be handled by Raffles Air. The Plaintiff Company was supposed to reimburse Raffles Air for the expenses which the latter incurred in this regard. Pursuant to this, the Plaintiff Company made several payments to the Tan Family, in reliance on representations by Tan Seck Chee or Jenny Chaw that the funds were meant for the Holocaust Event’s logistics:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"/>(a)     Between 15 November 2014 and 7 January 2015 (both days inclusive), the Plaintiff Company made several payments to Tan Seck Chee totalling US$50,000.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"/>(b)     On 2 February 2015, the Plaintiff Company paid Wendy Tan S$50,000.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"/>(c)     On 25 February 2015, the Plaintiff Company paid Jenny Chaw S$50,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>The Plaintiff Company claimed that the representations were fraudulent as the sums paid were never applied to the Holocaust Event. The Plaintiff Company thus sued for recovery of the amounts paid, by way of restitution.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       In their Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendants raised a host of defences. Of relevance to the appeals before me is the defence of illegality. Specifically:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"/>(a)     The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff Company was the alter ego of Pastor George, who had used the Plaintiff Company to solicit donations.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"/>(b)     It was illegal for the Plaintiff Company to engage in soliciting such donations as it was neither a charity registered under the Charities Act 1994 (Cap 37, 2007 Rev Ed) (“Charities Act”) nor an Institution of Public Character.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"/>(c)     The monies raised by the Plaintiff Company were thus tainted with illegality, meaning that any action by the Plaintiff Company against the Defendants to recover such monies would be contrary to public policy.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applications for discovery and the decision below</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     The Defendants filed the applications in DC/SUM 2447/2022 (in DC 1572) and DC/SUM 2446/2022 (in DC 1939), seeking specific discovery of the following five categories of documents:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(A)    The Plaintiff Company’s financial statements for financial years 2016 to 2020 (both years inclusive).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(B)    The Plaintiff Company’s accounting records between 2014 and 2020 (both years inclusive), including but not limited to entries showing sums of monies received and expended, and the matters in respect of which the receipts and expenditures took place.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(C)    The Plaintiff Company’s bank statements between 2014 and 2020 (both years inclusive).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(D)    Publicity and/or solicitation material between 2014 and 2020 (both years inclusive), for the Plaintiff Company’s fundraising and/or collection of its donations.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(E)    The Plaintiff Company’s fund-raising permit(s)/ license(s) for between 2014 and 2020 (both years inclusive).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     In both suits, the learned DR below granted the application for discovery of the documents in categories (A) to (C), finding that the documents were:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">material, necessary and relevant to the disputes at hand, in particular, the illegality defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>However, the learned DR denied the application for discovery of the documents in categories (D) and (E).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     There has been <em>no</em> appeal by:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"/>(a)     the Plaintiff Company, in respect of the order granting discovery of the documents in categories (A) to (C).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"/>(b)     the Defendants, in respect of the learned DR’s refusal to grant discovery of the documents in category (E).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>The appeals before me relate only to category (D): the Defendants maintain that the learned DR was wrong in denying their application for discovery of documents in this category.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     Before the learned DR, the Plaintiff Company adduced affidavits sworn by Pastor George, where he averred, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Plaintiff Company <b><em>does not have the documents in category (D) in its possession, custody or power</em></b>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The learned DR relied on this averment in dismissing the specific discovery application in respect of category (D). Specifically, the learned DR held:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, since the plaintiff has confirmed on affidavit that it does not have custody and possession of documents in Cat D and E, I will grant Order In Terms (“OIT”) for prayers 1 to 3 in respect of documents in Cat A to C.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     O 24 r 3 of the Rules of Court states that a list of documents made in compliance with an order for discovery must be in Form 37. Form 37 in turn requires the party providing discovery to enumerate, <em>inter alia</em>:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"/>(a)     documents which were <b><em>previously</em></b> in his possession, custody or power; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"/>(b)     what became of those documents and whose possession they now resided with.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     As such, the mere fact that a party deposes on affidavit that he does not have possession, custody or power of the documents is not sufficient, in and of itself, to foreclose an order for specific discovery. Such a deposition, when restricted to the present tense, falls short of stating whether the party <em>previously</em> had the documents in his possession, custody or power. In such situations, the affidavit does not fully comply with Form 37, as required by O 24 r 3 of the Rules of Court. It would therefore still be open to the court to order specific discovery, even if doing so is for the sole purpose of compelling that party to explain what became of the documents which he claims to no longer have.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     This position aligns with the views expressed by AR Goh Yihan (as he then was) in <em>MCST Plan No 689 v DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/57572-M.xml')">[2008] SGHC 98</a> (“<em>MCST v DTZ</em>”) (at [33]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">As to the exercise of the court’s discretion, if the purpose of an order made under O 24 r 5 is to compel the other party to make an affidavit in the terms as stated in r 5(1), then it is arguable that if the other part makes an affidavit on such terms in response to the application, the purpose of O 24 r 5 would be fulfilled. There would be no further reason to make the order under O 24 r 5(1) since its purpose has already been fulfilled. However, the situation would be different if the affidavit does not fully meet the requirements prescribed under O 24 r 5. This is because <b><em>the other party might well say that he does not have possession, custody or power of the documents concerned, but that does not answer the question of what happened to the documents, as required under O 24 r 5</em></b>. In that case, the purpose of O 24 r 5 would still be operative. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     Reverting to the appeals before me, the fact that Pastor George’s affidavit merely averred that the Plaintiff Company does not have possession, custody or power of the category (D) documents thus cannot be determinative. His affidavit made no mention of what became of these documents and whose possession they now reside with. The requirements set out in O 24 r 3 of the Rules of Court and Form 37 have thus not been fully complied with.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     For this reason, I am of the view that the learned DR erred in anchoring her decision (to deny specific discovery of the category (D) documents) on the averment in Pastor George’s affidavit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     While I am not precluded from ordering specific discovery, there still remains the question of whether I <em>should</em> order specific discovery, based on the materials before me. In approaching that question, I am mindful of the fact that discovery should be ordered only if:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"/>(a)     The documents are <em>relevant</em>; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"/>(b)     discovery is <em>necessary</em>, either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs:</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>see <em>MCST v DTZ</em> ([16] <em>supra</em> at [45]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevance of the documents </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     Insofar as the relevance of the category (D) documents are concerned, there is a preliminary point I need to deal with. Counsel for the Defendants contends that the learned DR below specifically found that that the documents sought were relevant to the Defendants’ defence of illegality. It was on this basis that she ordered discovery of Categories (A) to (C). Counsel thus submits that as the Plaintiff Company has not appealed against this order, it should be taken to have acquiesced to the position that the documents <em>are</em> relevant. Accordingly, counsel for the Defendants argues that relevance is no longer an issue in these appeals, even for the category (D) documents, and suggests that I have no jurisdiction to examine the issue of relevance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     This is a rather sweeping assertion that is neither supported by law nor the facts. The appeals before me operate as a rehearing and I am not bound by the learned DR’s findings below. Counsel for the Defendants has failed to identify any legal basis for saying that the jurisdiction to rule on the issue of relevance is taken out of my hands. The position the Plaintiff Company has adopted in the appeals before me makes it clear that the issue of relevance is very much a live one. Given the absence of any explanation from the Defendants as to why the Plaintiff Company should be regarded as estopped from raising the issue of relevance, I take the view that this is an issue I must squarely deal with.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     Moving on to the substantive issue of relevance, the starting point is that “relevance” in the specific discovery context is informed by the clauses in O 24 r 5(3) of the Rules of Court. For example, a document would be relevant if it is something that the applicant will rely on or if it will adversely affect the other party’s case (see <em>eg</em> O 24 r 5(3)(<em>a</em>)–(<em>b</em>) of the Rules of Court). It is also important to bear in mind that relevance should not be assessed in vacuo, but with reference to the <em>pleadings</em> of the case at hand: see <em>MCST v DTZ</em> ([16] <em>supra</em>) at [46]. As such, if a party claims that documents are relevant to a point that he wishes to prove, but that point has no bearing on any party’s pleaded case, the requisite nexus for establishing relevance would be absent. In this case, counsel for the Defendants contends that the category (D) documents are relevant as they would show the nature and extent of the Plaintiff Company’s allegedly illegal fundraising activities, thereby establishing the defence that the funds paid by the Plaintiff Company to the Defendants were tainted by illegality.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     The Plaintiff Company counters that the documents are irrelevant, notwithstanding their nexus to the pleaded defence of illegality. It argues that just because a point has been pleaded does not mean that documents related to that point must necessarily be regarded as relevant, particularly if that point concerned is <em>itself</em> irrelevant. This would be the position even if no application has been taken to strike out that (irrelevant) point. In support of this proposition, the Plaintiff Company cites the Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision in <em>Allington Investments Corporation &amp; ors v First Pacific Bancshares Holdings Ltd &amp; anor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('http://www2.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgieng/hk/cases/hkca/1995/528.html')">[1995] HKCA 528</a> (“<em>Allington Investments</em>”), where Chan J held (at [18]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the learned deputy judge fell into error when he held the view that the relevance of an issue can be dictated by a party unilaterally simply by placing it in his pleadings. <b><em>Even if the opposing party has failed to apply to strike out an irrelevant allegation in the pleadings of the other side, he is not barred from taking the point in an application for specific discovery that the allegation made in the pleadings is irrelevant to the subject matter of the action and ought to be disregarded for the purpose of discovery. The court is certainly not bound to take account of any immaterial or irrelevant averment of fact improperly inserted into the pleadings by a party</em></b>. Otherwise, the court will become helpless and innocent litigants will be held to ransom. An abuse of the discovery process in this manner not only frustrates the legitimate objectives of the judicial process, it will bring the administration of justice into disrepute. A denial, or an implied joinder on pleadings, by the opposing party per se is not sufficient to bring relevance to an otherwise wholly irrelevant allegation. The relevance of an issue, or of a document, is dependent on its substance and contents in the light of the subject matter of the trial; and not simply on its mere presence in pleadings or the existence of a denial of it by a party. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     I am of the view that the Plaintiff Company’s reliance on <em>Allington Investments</em> is misplaced. In <em>Allington Investments</em>, the plaintiffs were appealing against a specific discovery order that the defendants successfully obtained. Although the order was for discovery of documents that related to a point that was specifically pleaded in the defence, Chan J opined that this point was <b>factually irrelevant</b>, based on the face of the pleadings alone. Specifically, Chan J held that the point bore a “<em>total absence of factual link</em>” (at [16]) with the claim brought by the plaintiffs. Chan J opined that the point was “<em>certainly not a material fact for the resolution of the subject matter of the claim</em>” (at [16]). As such, the court held that the specific discovery order should not have been made, notwithstanding that it related to a point that had been specifically pleaded by the defendants.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     That is very different from what we have here. The defence of illegality was explicitly pleaded in the Defences for both suits. The Defendants hope to use the solicitation materials in category (D) to build their case that the circumstances under which donations were solicited by the Plaintiff Company (which was neither a registered charity nor an Institution of Public Character) breached the provisions of the Charities Act. The Defendants refer to the 2014 accounts of the Plaintiff Company,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> highlighting that practically all the Plaintiff Company’s 2014 revenue came from donations. From this, the Defendants seek to weave the argument that the monies paid out to the Defendants in DC 1939, or paid on the Defendants’ behalf in DC 1572, <em>must</em> have come from donations (there being no other source of revenue). This, coupled with the assertion that any donations raised by the Plaintiff Company would have been illegal, forms the backbone of the Defendants’ illegality defence. Based on this factual matrix, I am at this interlocutory juncture unable to affirmatively say (as the court in <em>Allington Investments</em> was able to say) that the illegality defence has “<em>a total absence of factual link</em>” with the claim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     To attack the relevance of the illegality defence, the Plaintiff Company raises a slew of factual assertions −all of which are the subject of intense contest −to show why the illegality defence cannot hold. These assertions, found in Pastor George’s affidavit,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> include the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"/>(a)     By way of background, the Defendants had sought to give a flavour of the Plaintiff Company’s allegedly illegal fundraising activities, by exhibiting samples of solicitation materials purportedly sent by the Plaintiff Company (including emails signed off by Pastor George).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> However, the Plaintiff Company (through Pastor George’s affidavit)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> vigorously asserts that these materials are not in any way suggestive of illegality. For example, Pastor George deposed that these materials pertained to private solicitation (which the Plaintiff Company asserts to be legal) and not public fundraising. Pastor George also deposed to how some of these materials failed to explicitly reference the Plaintiff Company.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"/>(b)     Pastor George’s affidavit also raised various other assertions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> as to why the claim of illegality cannot hold. For example, he deposed to how there has never been any criminal investigations against the Plaintiff Company. He also deposed to how the Plaintiff Company’s accounts were audited, and the issue of illegality was never raised. He also deposed to how Tan Seck Chee, despite now raising the defence of illegality, was an office bearer of the Plaintiff Company’ sister entity. In that capacity, Tan Seck Chee previously declared to the Israeli authorities that certain funds being remitted to Israel were proper and legal. Pastor George’s affidavit also exhibited<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> the letter where Tan Seck Chee made that declaration to the Israeli authorities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>It is clear that points (a) and (b) above pertain to assertions by Pastor George to undermine the <em>credibility</em> of the illegality defence and not its <b><em>relevance</em></b>. Given that these allegations are largely grounded on facts that are the subject of intense contest, they are better left for adjudication at trial. They certainly do not suffice for me, at this interlocutory stage, to dismiss the pleaded defence of illegality as being irrelevant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     Notwithstanding that the underlying facts are contested, I am mindful that it might still be open to the Plaintiff Company to take out an application to impugn the illegality defence on account of <em>legal</em> unsustainability, <em>ie</em> that there is no illegality at law, even if all the facts are assumed to be as depicted in the Plaintiff Company’s pleadings. However, the Plaintiff Company has not done that. Nor has it raised any arguments before me as to legal unsustainability of the illegality defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     As such, based on the materials before me, I am of the view that the fund solicitation documents in category (D) are relevant.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Necessity of the documents </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     To recapitulate, the materials for which the Defendants seek discovery must not only be <em>relevant</em> but <b>necessary</b> as well, either:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"/>(a)     for disposing fairly of the cause or matter; or</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"/>(b)     for saving costs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>This requirement for necessity is encapsulated in O 24 r 7 of the Rules of Court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     While documents failing to meet the relevance threshold would not be necessary, the converse may not hold true. Documents which <em>are relevant</em> may not always be deemed as necessary: see <em>Bayerissche Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore)</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 4 SLR(R) 0039.xml')">[2004] 4 SLR(R) 39</a> (at [37]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     The Plaintiff Company argues that the documents would not be necessary for saving costs because it would be costly for it to procure the documents, given the number of years over which the documents stretched.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> However, the fact that procurement of the documents entails some cost would not, in and of itself, be a bar to ordering discovery. Any steps to comply with a discovery order must necessarily incur costs, so that cannot be an objection <em>per se</em>. The test is one of <em>saving</em> costs. This means that if discovery of the documents, while costly, results in an overall saving of costs over the course of the proceedings, the discovery order can be made. In this case, to the extent that the documents could help focus the scope of the illegality defence, cost savings could still be achieved. Nevertheless, I am mindful of the timeframe to which the discovery order should be restricted, and how this needs to be tempered to avoid costs ballooning to unnecessary proportions – I will return to that below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     It also bears noting that costs saving is not the only prong for establishing necessity under O 24 r 7. If the documents are necessary for “disposing fairly of the cause or matter”, the test of necessity would also be met. On this front, the Plaintiff Company’s argument appears to be that the documents are not necessary because they are not relevant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> As I have already explained above, I find that the documents <em>are</em> relevant, so this objection fails. Given that the circumstances by which the Plaintiff Company conducted its fundraising goes to the heart of the illegality defence, the documents in category (D) can be considered as necessary, to the extent that they allow the court to fairly dispose of the issue of whether that defence is made out.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Adjusting the timeframe for the discovery orders </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     In the spirit of ordering discovery of only what is necessary, I do not propose to grant the Defendants an order for specific discovery that spans the entire time horizon proposed in their application. The Defendants are asking for solicitation documents stretching from the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2020 (seven years in total). To grant an order in terms of that date range will likely inflate the costs to a point that might be regarded as unnecessary. I set out my reasons below.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     In respect of DC 1939, the payments made by the Plaintiff Company to the Tan Family (which the Defendants allege came from illegally solicited donations) were made from 15 November 2014 to 25 February 2015 (both days inclusive).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In light of this, I adjust the timeframe for the discovery order as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"/>(a)     I accept the Defendants’ position that the <b>start date</b> of the timeframe should be the beginning of 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"/>(b)     However, the <b>end date</b> cannot be 2020. On the pleadings, the very last payment made by the Plaintiff Company to the Tan Family was on 25 February 2015. Any funds raised by the Plaintiff Company after that point could not have been used to make the payments that are the subject of the Plaintiff Company’s claim in DC 1939. The Defendants have not explained why the specific discovery order should cover solicitation materials sent after 25 February 2015, to the very end of 2020. This would extend for more than 5 years after the Plaintiff Company’s last payment to the Tan Family.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>As such, for the discovery application in DC 1939, I order that the solicitation materials discovered shall pertain to those sent out from <u>1 January 2014 to 25 February 2015</u> (both days inclusive).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     In respect of DC 1572, the payments made by the Plaintiff Company to Travel 360 (which the Defendants allege came from illegally solicited donations) were made from 6 December 2018 to 19 February 2019 (both days inclusive).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In light of this, I adjust the timeframe for the discovery order as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"/>(a)     The <b>start date</b> of the timeframe cannot commence from the beginning of 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_35-p2_a-p3_i"/>(i)       Firstly, by way of comparison, looking at DC 1939, the first payment by the Plaintiff Company to the Tan Family was made on 15 November 2014 (see [8(a)] above). Yet, the Defendants only sought solicitation materials that were sent from the beginning of January 2014 (<em>ie</em>, the documents sought were for a timeframe preceding the first payment by only 10½ months). However, for DC 1572, where the Plaintiff Company’s first payment to Travel 360 was made on 6 December 2018, the Defendants sought to discovery of fundraising materials stretching for <b><em>almost 5 years</em></b> before that. This inconsistent stance over the start date, as between DC 1939 and DC 1572, was never rationalised in the Defendant’s submissions.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_35-p2_a-p3_ii"/>(ii)       Secondly, if one looks at the Plaintiff Company’s accounts,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> one sees that the yearly expenditure is a substantial portion of the donations collected. In other words, the carryover of surplus donations from one financial year to the next is very low. In light of this, insofar as payments made in 2018 are concerned, the relevance of any fundraising activities appears to grow more remote as we travel further back in time to 2014.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_35-p2_a-p3_iii"/>(iii)       Thirdly, I also bear in mind that it would be costly for the Plaintiff Company to unearth solicitation materials from over so many years in the past.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>I thus adjust the start date for the specific discovery order in DC 1572 from 1 January 2014 to 1 January 2017. This means that the documents discovered will span a timeframe of over 23 months prior to the first payment on 6 December 2018 (<em>ie</em>, between 1 January 2017 to 6 December 2018). As this is more than double the corresponding timeframe of 10½ months in DC 1939, I see little reason for complaint by the Defendants.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"/>(b)     Insofar as the <b>end date</b> of the timeframe is concerned, the Defendants have not explained why it should stretch to the end of 2020. Any funds raised by the Plaintiff Company after 19 February 2019 could not have been used to make the payments that are the subject of the Plaintiff Company’s claim in DC 1572. Counsel for the Defendants has thus conceded that the end date should not stretch for that far.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>As such, for the discovery application in DC 1572, I order that the solicitation materials discovered shall pertain to those sent out from <u>1 January 2017 and 19 February 2019</u> (both days inclusive).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     By adjusting the timeframes for the discovery orders in the above manner, I have tried to achieve some semblance of balance between:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"/>(a)     allowing the Defendants to secure the documents that are relevant to the illegality defence; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"/>(b)     managing the costs to the Plaintiff Company of having to scour through documents from many years past, where the relevance of these documents to the illegality defence grows more tenuous with vintage.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     The appeals are thus allowed, subject to the date range of the discovery orders being revised as explained above.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     I grant orders in terms of prayers 1 to 3 of DC/SUM 2447/2022 (in DC 1572) and DC/SUM 2446/2022 (in DC 1939), in respect of the documents listed in category (D) of the schedule to both summonses, save that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"/>(a)     For DC/SUM 2447/2022 (in DC 1572), the solicitation materials to be discovered shall be those sent out between 1 January 2017 and 19 February 2019 (both days inclusive).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"/>(b)     For DC/SUM 2446/2022 (in DC 1939), the solicitation materials to be discovered shall be those sent out between 1 January 2014 to 25 February 2015 (both days inclusive).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     I re-iterate that the list of documents to be furnished by the Plaintiff Company in compliance with the discovery orders I make today must comply with Form 37 of the Rules of Court. In other words, if the Plaintiff Company states that it no longer has the documents, it must explain:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"/>(a)     what were the documents <b><em>previously</em></b> in its possession, custody or power; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"/>(b)     what became of these documents and in whose possession they now reside.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     Counsel for the Defendants has submitted that based on the evidence adduced thus far, I <em>must</em> draw the inference that a reasonable suspicion exists that the Plaintiff Company still possesses the documents in category (D) presently (notwithstanding the sworn affidavit of Pastor George). A case in point where such an inference was made is <em>Soh Lup Chee v Seow Boon Cheng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0604.xml')">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 604</a> (“<em>Soh Lup Chee</em>”). However, the stage of proceedings in <em>Soh Lup Chee</em> was far more advanced than in this present appeal. In <em>Soh Lup Chee</em>, the plaintiff had <b>already made</b> certain specific discovery applications which had been <em>thwarted</em> by the defendants. The plaintiff had then resorted to applying for an order striking out the defence. It was against this backdrop of a striking out application that Choo J examined the evidence and made the following observation (at [7]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first and basic point counsel made was that it is inconceivable, taking into account the type and size of the company …, and the nature of its work and projects that no record is kept of the supporting or source documents. I agree with this submission entirely, and in my view, there is more than a reasonable suspicion that such documents must have existed and continue to exist.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>Choo J then concluded (at [11]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have amply demonstrated, through their counsel, the numerous obvious omissions of documents that must surely exist, or to be more precise, have existed. If they are no longer in the defendants’ possession a reasonable explanation ought to have been given but no explanation was given by them. In my view, therefore, the plaintiffs have made out a sufficient case to strike out the defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     In the present case, I am only just granting the order for specific discovery. The Plaintiff Company has adduced an affidavit from Pastor George that he does not have the documents in category (D) in his possession, but there is <em>as yet</em> no averment by the Plaintiff Company as to whether it <em>previously had those documents, or what became of them</em>. This would have to be canvassed by the Plaintiff Company in its response to the specific discovery orders which I am granting today. If the Plaintiff Company files a List of Documents and Affidavit verifying the same and that still fails to satisfy the Defendants, the latter will of course be free to take out whatever application they deem fit and, in doing so, invite the court to make the necessary inferences then. Pending that, it is premature for me to draw the inference that counsel for the Defendants submits that I must now make. I thus decline to draw such an inference.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     I will now hear parties’ submissions on the costs of the appeals.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>See ¶15(b) &amp; ¶28 of Pastor George’s affidavit, sworn on 5 August 2022 and filed in DC 1572, as well as and ¶15(b) &amp; ¶29 of Pastor George’s affidavit, sworn on 5 August 2022 and filed in DC 1939.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Exhibited at p 38 of the second affidavit of Tan Seck Chee (“TSC2”) filed in DC 1939.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Sworn on 5 August 2022 and filed in DC 1939.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>See TSC2 pp 68-98.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>At ¶28.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>At ¶23.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>At p 13.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>Although I am unable to tell from the letter exactly what funds Tan Seck Chee was referring to.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>See ¶¶ 39 &amp; 41 of the Plaintiff Company’s appeal submissions.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>See ¶ 35 of the Plaintiff Company’s appeal submissions.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_11_1" id="Ftn_11">[note: 11]</a></sup>See ¶¶9-19 of the SoC in DC 1939.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_12_1" id="Ftn_12">[note: 12]</a></sup>See ¶11 of the SoC in DC 1572.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_13_1" id="Ftn_13">[note: 13]</a></sup>In TSC2 p 38.</p></div></content></root> </div> <form name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm" action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap4 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner" > <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
