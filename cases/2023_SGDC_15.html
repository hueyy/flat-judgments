District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"/>1       The accused Simon Tham, an operations manager age 52 years, claimed trial to one charge of having breath alcohol that exceeded the prescribed limit under section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“the RTA”). He said that the Bonjela gel he was applying had affected the breathalyser test reading.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       I convicted the accused. He was previously convicted for drink-driving in February 2016 and I sentenced him to an imprisonment term of three weeks with fine of $6000, and disqualification all classes for four years from release. The accused appeals against conviction and sentence and is on bail pending appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       The accused was charged as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>DAC 919501-2019</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You… are charged that on 14 June 2019, at or about 2.00am, in the vicinity of the open carpark near Blk 146 Yishun Street 11, Singapore, when driving motor van GBG3288G, did have so much alcohol in your body that the proportion of it in your breath, to wit, not less than <b>75 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath</b>, exceeded the prescribed limit of 35 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">And further, that you, before the committing of the said offence, that is to say that on 25 February 2016, had been convicted in Subordinate Court No. 21 for an offence of Drink Driving under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 (DAC/944524/15), which conviction has not been set aside, and you are now liable for enhanced punishment under s67(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background and Overview of the parties’ cases </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       On the night of 13 June 2019 the accused drank some beer in a pub. In the early morning hours of 14 June 2019 he drove his motor van GBG3288G home and parked in an open air carpark at Blk 146 Yishun St 11 near his home. At the carpark an argument arose between the complainant and the accused, and the former called the police saying "Drunk Driver Want to Hit Me".</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       At about 2am on 14 June 2019, two police officers arrived at the open air carpark. The accused smelt of alcohol and he was subjected to a mobile breathalyser test, which he failed. He was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and escorted to Woodlands Police Division HQ (“Woodlands HQ”) for further investigations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       On the same day at about 4.04am at Woodlands Police Division HQ, a breath test using the Drager Alcotest 9510SG machine (“Alcotest SG”) was administered. On the first blow, the machine recorded a failed blow with a message “ALC. CONC. NOT STABLE” (meaning Alcohol Concentration Not Stable). On the accused’s second blow, the test recorded the proportion of alcohol in the accused's breath at 75 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       Prosecution called seven witnesses, including the police officer administering the breath test using the Alcotest SG, a forensic scientist from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) and Drager personnel. Prosecution relied on the assumption in section 71A(1)RTA that the proportion of alcohol in the accused’s breath at the time of the alleged offence was not less than that in his breath specimen.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       The accused elected to give evidence and called his own expert witness to testify on the ingestion of Bonjela on the breath alcohol concentration.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       On the night before his arrest, as he had only consumed less than half a jug of beer there was no way his alcohol level could be 75 micrograms per 100 millilitres based on the amount of alcohol he had consumed that night. He had been suffering from ulcers and a toothache and regularly applying Bonjela gel all day including prior to his arrest and this had elevated the breathalyser reading.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Evidence for the prosecution </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events of 14 June 2019</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     The arresting officer Sgt Bernard Lau Meng Wai (PW1) testified that a call had come in at about 120am on 14 June 2019 and he arrived at the open air carpark with his partner about 140am.

When alcohol is ingested, it circulates in the blood, and the blood in the lungs reaches equilibrium with the air surrounding the blood vessels. The ethanol in alcohol goes in and out of the blood vessels into the surrounding air in the lungs in an on-going process. Breath alcohol analysis relies on the equilibrium which occurs in the lungs between the inspired air and the pulmonary blood in the lungs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     When a breath alcohol reading is positive, this could arise from the alcohol in the blood (“blood alcohol”) of a subject, and also from the presence of any alcohol that could be in the subject’s mouth (“mouth alcohol”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Based on scientific studies, any alcohol present in the mouth would drop to zero within 20 minutes, whether this was alcohol present in the mouth from drinking, alcohol spray or Bonjela gel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     Aside from the presence of mouth alcohol, breathalyser readings can also be elevated after belching if there is unabsorbed alcohol present in high concentration in the subject’s stomach. Based on scientific studies, alcohol is usually completely absorbed in the stomach within 60 minutes after alcohol intake, as the alcohol will then either be released into the intestines or absorbed through the stomach wall, although in some individuals this may take up to 120 minutes. However when the absorption of alcohol is complete, there is minimum or close to zero alcohol in the stomach.

It contains two sensors - an infrared sensor and an electrochemical fuel cell sensor. The breath of the subject is analysed for alcohol concentration by both the infrared sensor and the electrochemical fuel cell sensor. The test result reading is what is measured by the infrared sensor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     The infrared sensor contains an infrared curvette, which is a channel with an emitter on one side and a detector on the other side. The emitter emits an infrared signal and the detected signal varies according to the alcohol concentration in the breath. The electrochemical fuel cell sensor also measures alcohol concentration by emitting an electric current to measure the alcohol concentration. It is used as a second sensor to ensure that the results from the two sensors are similar enough and to verify the measured concentration.

After he parked, he sat inside his vehicle checking his handphone for messages. As the pain in his mouth crept up again he started to apply Bonjela gel. Suddenly he heard someone slamming his hand on the side of his vehicle. An angry young man appeared, slapped his windscreen, started screaming and pulled at his door handle.

However the court agreed with the observations of the English High Court in <em>DPP v Dukolli</em> [2009] EWHC 3097 that although the court had a discretion to find that the assumption could be discharged without scientific evidence, this would only be in the comparatively rare case where a layman could reliably and confidently say that the post-event alcohol could explain the excess alcohol in the accused’s breath.

Based on the matters in dispute, the issues to be determined on a balance of probabilities was whether the Bonjela gel applied after the accused stopped driving had elevated the breathalyser reading and if it had, that his breath alcohol concentration would not have exceeded the prescribed limit if he had not done so.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Assessment of Evidence and Findings</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there mouth alcohol affecting the breathalyser at the time of the test ?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Time of the accused’s last application of Bonjela gel material </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"/>57     The Alcotest SG breathalyser tests were conducted from 404am to 410am on 14 June 2019.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"/>58     As to whether there was mouth alcohol present, I accepted the evidence of PW5 that this had to be assessed with reference to when the subject last applied Bonjela gel. Any Bonjela gel applied earlier throughout the day would have been gone into his system through drinking and swallowing and would not affect the breathalyser conducted at 404am.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"/>59     As to when the accused last applied Bonjela gel before he took the breathalyser test, I accepted the accused’s testimony that he had applied Bonjela gel before he drove off from the pub, and then again when he was seated in his vehicle checking his handphone before the incident with the complainant. This had been mentioned in his police statement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> However I rejected his further claims in court that he may also have applied Bonjela during the argument with the complainant in the carpark or when he was inside the patrol car on the way to the police station, which were not mentioned in his police statement. These were also improbable claims, considering the circumstances he was in at that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"/>60     As regards the timing of the last application of Bonjela gel by the accused, PW1 the arresting officer testified that he had arrived at the carpark at about 140am. Although the agreed facts stated that the complainant had made the call “at or about 2am”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> PW1 explained that the Cubicon system was down that night and the first information report had been manually created only at 203am. He recalled that the call had come in at about 120am. Their response time to the incident location was about 15 to 20 minutes, and they had arrived at the incident location at about 140am.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"/>61     From the arrest report, the police at the scene were already administering the mobile breathalyser at 155am and 210am,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> and the mobile breathalyser had been brought to the incident location by another patrol car. PW1 had given a detailed explanation as to why he was certain he had arrived at the incident location before 2am and I accepted his evidence. The accused himself had put the police arrival at between 1 to 120am,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> and later said that the police had arrived about 135am.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Counsel’s representation letter had also put the police arrival at 130am.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> All this was consistent with PW1’s testimony that he had already arrived at the scene before 2am.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"/>62     However it could not be pinned with any precision when the accused had last applied Bonjela gel while seated in his vehicle and checking his handphone, which was before the altercation with the complainant took place and before the police arrival. At the most favourable to the accused, for assessment purposes I took the accused’s last application of Bonjela gel to be at no later than 140am when PW1 arrived at the scene.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Experts agreed that in normal circumstances mouth alcohol from Bonjela gel would drop to zero within 10 to 20 minutes</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"/>63     PW5 the HSA expert testified that based on scientific studies any alcohol present in the mouth would drop to zero within 20 minutes. Although the studies dealt with alcoholic drinks, this would be true of Bonjela as the gel once ingested would not remain a gel-like substance and would dissolve into a liquid no different from alcoholic drinks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> Although HSA did not conduct their own tests, PW5’s opinion was based on published scientific studies and the tests conducted by Alcotech.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> Defence had also urged that due weight be given to PW5’s evidence given her expertise and experience and that she was trained in the fields of biological and clinical toxicology analysis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"/>64     I found PW5 to be a fair and candid witness. She gave clear and lucid testimony free of technical jargon on how breathalysers measured blood alcohol and the effect of mouth alcohol and belching, supported by sound explanations for her opinions. Before DW1 took the stand to clarify his Alcotech test report, PW5 had fairly pointed out that the Alcotech report described the accused as “ingesting” Bonjela, and the test should have simulated as closely as possible that the accused had applied gel in his oral cavity. This was because having the accused ingest or swallow the gel was more equivalent to the accused taking alcohol directly into his system, and the Alcotech mouth alcohol readings might otherwise have taken longer than 10 minutes to drop to zero.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"/>65     I accepted PW5’s testimony that under normal circumstances the alcohol in Bonjela would have dropped to zero in the oral cavity within 20 minutes after application. This was consistent with the Defence’s Alcotech test report, which showed that the mouth alcohol readings from the application of Bonjela dropping to zero in 10 minutes. I also accepted PW5’s opinion that it was unlikely that the accused’s application of Bonjela gel had any significant contribution to the Alcotest SG breathalyser test conducted at 404am. I found that under normal circumstances there would not have been any residual mouth alcohol arising from the Bonjela gel applied in the accused’s oral cavity that could have affected the breathalyser test taken at 404am.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line slowing the evaporation of alcohol?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"/>66     In closing, Defence initially alluded to Bonjela trapped in the crack-line of the accused’s tooth contributing to a higher breathalyser reading<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. However in their Further Closing Submissions, the only submission was that belching had inflated the second breathalyser test reading.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> However for completeness I will deal with whether there was any Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line that could have contributed to the breathalyser readings.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"/>67     As explained by PW5 the HSA expert, the significance of Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line was that the rate of evaporation of mouth alcohol would slow down from the usual 20 minutes, as gel trapped in the crack-line was not exposed and alcohol might still be detected after more than 20 minutes. A trace of Bonjela in the crack-line could potentially give rise to a high reading because of the percentage of ethanol in Bonjela. For example 10 milligrams of gel trapped in the tooth could give rise to 3300 micrograms of ethanol.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"/>68     I accepted that the accused had a crack in his upper molar, as this was supported by the dental memo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> I also accepted that it was possible that Bonjela gel could have become been trapped in the tooth crack-line which would have slowed down the evaporation of alcohol from his oral cavity.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"/>69     However the primary issue here was whether factually there was any Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line producing mouth alcohol when the breathalyser tests were done at 404am that morning. Defence failed to tender any evidence on this issue but instead sought to rely heavily on the HSA expert PW5’s testimony.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"/>70     In her report PW5 stated that the possibility of Bonjela contributing to the breathalyser reading could not be totally ruled out based on a single breathalyser reading.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"/>71     In court PW5 explained that to safeguard against the mouth alcohol defence, most studies emphasized doing duplicate breathalyser readings at least two minutes apart to rule out mouth alcohol, and this was practised in many countries. The mouth alcohol effect was random and would change every time a subject breathed out, as could be seen from the results of the Alcotech test report. If two breathalyser tests were done one or two minutes apart and there was mouth alcohol, the two significantly different readings would alert that the readings were not reliable and that mouth alcohol was present.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"/>72     I also accepted PW 5’s evidence she could not rule out the presence of mouth alcohol based on a single breathalyser reading. This was a fair statement and she had based her opinion on the practice of other countries and the studies. The Alcotech witness DW1 had also given a similar opinion that Bonjela gel trapped in the crack-line would prohibit the evaporation of mouth alcohol in a timely manner, although he himself had not conducted any investigation on this as he was not aware that the accused had a cracked tooth.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"/>73     This notwithstanding, PW5 had made it clear in her testimony that she was not testifying that the only way to rule out mouth alcohol from Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line was to conduct two breathalyser tests, nor was she saying there was indeed Bonjela gel trapped in the accused’s tooth crack-line when the Alcotest SG breathalyser tests were done.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"/>74     First, PW5 highlighted that she was not familiar with the workings of the Alcotest SG device and was unable to comment on whether the machine could detect mouth alcohol or Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line. She expressly noted that the vendors of breathalyser machines would have their own safeguards on how the machines detect mouth alcohol, and her opinion about taking two breathalyser readings to rule out mouth alcohol was one way to rule out the presence of mouth alcohol.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> PW5’s evidence therefore made it clear that there could be alternative ways to detect whether mouth alcohol was present.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"/>75     PW6 the Drager AG witness had testified that there were indeed two ways to detect and rule out mouth alcohol: through the analysis of the Alcotest SG’s alcohol curve, or to do two tests two minutes apart and compare the results.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"/>76     Second PW5 also made it clear that she was not saying that there was in fact Bonjela gel in the accused’s tooth crack-line when he took the breathalyser test more than two hours after his last application. She noted that no simulation experiment was done where gel was applied to the tooth crack-line to verify that Bonjela gel could get trapped and how long it would remain there. She was not a dentist and variables would include the size of the crack-line and the amount of gel that could have become trapped.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"/>77     Central to this defence that Bonjela gel trapped in the accused’s cracked tooth had elevated the breathalyser readings taken at 404am would be the need for the Defence, who bore the burden of proof on this issue, to point to some evidence that there could still be Bonjela gel trapped in the accused’s tooth crack-line producing mouth alcohol more than two hours after the accused’s last application of Bonjela gel. Neither the evidence of PW5 nor DW1 assisted the Defence on this issue. DW1 testified that his test had nothing to do with the effect of Bonjela gel being trapped in the accused’s upper right molar. He was not even aware that the accused had a cracked tooth when he conducted the tests.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"/>78     In any event the unrefuted evidence of the prosecution witnesses was that any remaining alcohol in the mouth would have been picked up as a Mouth Alcohol reading by the Alcotest SG, ruling out the defence claims that mouth alcohol had affected the breathalyser reading, and I will deal with this below. That the Alcotest SG was designed to and would have picked up the presence of any mouth alcohol was relevant to both the accused’s claims that gel trapped in his tooth crack-line and that belching had elevated the breathalyser readings.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alcotest SG sensors would have detected the presence of any mouth alcohol</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"/>79     PW6 the Drager AG witness was part of the team involved in the design and development of the Alcotest for the Singapore Police Force.

In a valid breathalyser reading, the breath alcohol concentration would be slowly rising as the subject blew into the breathalyser and would eventually reach a plateau, and this plateau measured the blood alcohol concentration of the subject. In a case where mouth alcohol was present, the breath alcohol concentration was raised and detected in the first part of the subject’s breath sample.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"/>82     PW6’s colleague PW7 Melvin Ong the senior lead engineer and team lead for technical and training from Drager Singapore (“Drager SG”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> elaborated that when there was mouth alcohol present, the machine would detect a higher alcohol concentration during the initial blow than at the end of the blow, and the alcohol curve would start from a high point and then curve downwards.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"/>83     PW6 testified that her evidence was based on her knowledge and expertise as to the functioning of the Alcotest device and scientific literature<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>, as Bonjela gel was not available in Germany she had not conducted any tests with Bonjela gel.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"/>84     PW7 had performed a Bonjela gel test using the Alcotest SG device in Singapore.

The Alcotest SG gave Mouth Alcohol readings in the first two breathalysers performed at 11:38-11:41, and at 11:44-11:46. At the third and subsequent breathalysers performed at 11:59-12:02 and subsequently, no mouth alcohol was detected.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"/>86     In the second series of tests conducted at 16:15, he used 2cm of Bonjela gel. Mouth Alcohol readings were given for the first two breathalysers conducted at 16:19-16:22 and from 16:25-16:28. At the third and subsequent breathalysers conducted from 16:33-16:36 onwards, no Mouth Alcohol was detected.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"/>87     Both tests showed that the Alcotest SG initially picked up positive mouth alcohol readings and gave Mouth Alcohol messages. No further Mouth Alcohol readings were given 19 minutes and 18 minutes into the first and second series of tests respectively. PW7’s tests corroborated the Drager witnesses’ testimony that the Alcotest SG would indeed pick up any Bonjela gel in the mouth as Mouth Alcohol readings.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"/>88     I found PW7, like PW5 the HSA witness, to be a candid and forthcoming witness who did not seek to over-reach on matters not within his expertise or what he had tested for. PW7 agreed that his test did not take into account the possibility of Bonjela trapped in the tooth cavity and offered that he himself did not have any cracked teeth.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> He also would not know whether the Alcotest SG would indicate Mouth Alcohol if there was any Bonjela gel trapped in the tooth crack-line because this would depend on the amount of Bonjela gel trapped which would affect the amount of alcohol concentration in the mouth.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> The purpose of his tests was only to show whether the Alcotest SG would react to the presence of Bonjela gel in his mouth cavity by giving Mouth Alcohol readings and it did so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"/>89     The burden was on Defence to show that there was mouth alcohol emanating from any gel trapped in the tooth crack-line at the time the accused took the breathalyser tests at 404am. PW7’s evidence did not assist the defence. The purpose of the tests PW7 conducted were not to show whether and how long Bonjela gel trapped in a tooth crack-line would produce mouth alcohol detectable by the Alcotest SG as Mouth Alcohol, and the burden did not lie on prosecution to establish this. On this issue I had accepted the unrebutted evidence of PW6 that the Alcotest SG device was designed to pick up the presence of any residual alcohol in the oral and tooth cavity as mouth alcohol.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did the Alcohol Concentration Not Stable (“ACNS”) error message indicate the presence of mouth alcohol or affect the validity of the second breathalyser reading? </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"/>90     Although this had not been raised in submissions, I considered whether the ACNS error message suggested the presence of mouth alcohol.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"/>91     I accepted the evidence of PW6 that the Mouth Alcohol and ACNS messages were generated from distinct breathalyser outcomes detected by the infrared sensor based on the analysis of the alcohol curve.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"/>92     The alcohol curve in a valid breath sample would detect a slowly rising alcohol concentration culminating in a plateau, correlating to the blood alcohol concentration in the subject’s deep lung air.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> I accepted PW6’s evidence that as a fail-safe mechanism, ACNS was a <em>specific</em> error message that would <em>only</em> be triggered by the device whenever the plateau at the end of a valid alcohol curve was not detected by the machine’s sensor, resulting in an alcohol curve greater than the set threshold of the instrument. A lack of plateau could arise for example if the sensor detected a still-rising breath alcohol concentration if the accused stopped mid-blow, or for other reasons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"/>93     As for the mouth alcohol curve, this was a distinct curve. PW7 had explained that whenever the alcohol concentration in the mouth was higher than the alcohol concentration detected in the lungs, the alcohol curve would be the reverse of an alcohol curve from a valid breath sample. The highest alcohol point would start first because of the mouth alcohol, with the alcohol curve starting high and then curving downwards.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"/>94     Finally I also accepted PW6’s evidence that the Alcotest SG was designed such that an accurate and reliable reading from a single breath sample would be sufficient to measure the breath alcohol concentration, and there was no need to take a second test to confirm the first reading.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"/>95     Whatever the reasons that gave rise to a lack of plateau in the failed first blow, I was satisfied that it was not due to the presence of mouth alcohol and it did not affect the validity of the second breathalyser reading. A valid breathalyser reading had been recorded by the Alcotest SG in the accused’s second breathalyser blow, which met all three parameters of minimum blow volume, minimum blow time and the detection of a plateau at the end of the alcohol curve. This single valid reading constituted a sufficient and reliable measure of the subject’s breath alcohol concentration.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the breathalyser reading elevated by belching\burping?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"/>96     Defence submitted in closing that the accused’s breathalyser reading of 75 µg/ml had been affected by the accused burping or belching.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Belching or burping elevate breathalyser reading only if unabsorbed alcohol present in subject’s stomach </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"/>97     PW5 the HSA expert explained how belching\burping (“burping”) could affect a breathalyser reading. When alcohol was ingested, it would usually take about 60 minutes for it to be absorbed though the stomach wall into the intestines. For some individuals this absorption would take 120 minutes.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"/>98     If an individual still had unabsorbed alcohol in his stomach, when he burped the alcohol vapour would come out and affect the breathalyser reading. However if all the alcohol had already been absorbed there would be close to zero alcohol in the stomach. No alcohol vapour would come out during burping or belching that would elevate the breathalyser reading and the breathalyser would only measure the subject’s blood alcohol concentration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> Bonjela gel would behave in the same way, as once in the stomach it would dissolve into liquid and was no different from alcoholic drinks that had been ingested by a subject.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"/>99     PW5’s explanation that unabsorbed alcohol released from belching\burping could affect a breathalyser reading was consistent with the results of the Alcotech test. The report showed that although the accused’s breathalyser was initially clear of positive alcohol readings 10 minutes after he applied Bonjela gel to his oral cavity, when the accused subsequently belched 42 minutes after the gel was applied, the breathalyser again recorded positive alcohol readings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"/>100    PW6 also testified that she was familiar with the functioning of the Lifeloc machine used in the Alcotech test. As the machine only had one electrochemical sensor, it could not measure the alcohol concentration over the subject’s entire breath sample or distinguish mouth alcohol.

PW6’s explanation was similar PW5’s that if the subject had any unabsorbed alcohol in his stomach when he burped, this would result in alcohol gas from the stomach re-entering his mouth. PW6’s evidence which I accepted was that the Alcotest SG would detect such gas as mouth alcohol and give a Mouth Alcohol reading.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> PW7 had also testified that any burping shortly before the breathalyser test would result in a Mouth Alcohol reading.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Claim of burping\belching an after-thought</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"/>107    Finally I found this claim of burping or belching to be contrived and an after-thought.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"/>108    Not once in his entire testimony, whether in evidence-in-chief or in cross-examination, did the accused mention that he had been affected by burping or belching at any time in the events leading up to or during his Alcotest SG breathalyser test. Neither was any burping or belching mentioned in his police statement at all. The factual basis supporting this burping\belching defence was completely absent in evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"/>109    Neither was it suggested to the officer performing the breathalyser PW2 that the accused had been burping or belching before or during the breathalyser test. It was not even clear whether Defence’s case was that the accused had burped before or during the breathalyser test, or both, as counsel had put different questions to PW7 about the effect of burping on the breathalyser test.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> Both Drager witnesses had in fact testified that burping in the midst of providing the blow for the breathalyser would be unusual.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> In any event, any suggestion that Bonjela gel could be causing the accused to burp or belch two hours or more after he last applied the gel appeared improbable. As seen from the Alcotest test, the accused was observed to be belching immediately after the gel was applied and then only one time at the 42-minute mark during the entire duration of the 1 hour 39 minutes the Alcotech test was conducted, even though the accused had applied 9 grams of gel to his oral cavity for the test.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"/>110    The defence that the breathalyser reading had been elevated by burping\belching was entirely speculative and an after-thought.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision - Guilty and Convicted </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"/>111    I found the evidence of the prosecution witnesses PW1 to PW3 and PW 4 to PW7 to be credible and accepted their evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"/>112    The breathalysers had been administered in accordance with procedures, and a valid breathalyser reading had been recorded in the accused’s second blow attempt. For the Alcotest SG, a single valid breath sample would be sufficient to measure the accused’s breath alcohol concentration, and a valid breathalyser reading of 75 µg/ml had been recorded in the accused’s second blow attempt. These was no need for a second confirmatory reading as the Alcotest SG had been designed with in-built safeguards and the presence of any mouth alcohol in the oral cavity, whether arising from gel trapped in a cracked tooth or released from burping\belching, would have been detected as mouth alcohol.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"/>113    The assumption that the accused’s minimum alcohol level at the time of the offence was 75 µg/ml was triggered. The burden did not lie on prosecution to prove that there was no burping or Bonjela gel trapped in the accused’s tooth which could have elevated the breathalyser tests taken by the accused at 404am that day. The burden lay on the accused to establish his claim on a balance of probabilities that his application of Bonjela gel after he stopped driving had elevated his breathalyser test readings, and further had he not done so, his breath alcohol concentration would not have exceeded the prescribed limit. He had failed to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"/>114    I did not find the accused to be a credible witness and I disbelieved his claims as to how much alcohol he had drank. In court he had made various attempts to embellish his defence. For example in his police statement he said he drank half a jug of beer and he last applied Bonjela gel while seated in his vehicle checking his handphone,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> but in court he claimed that he drank less than half a jug of beer and that he could have applied Bonjela gel after his altercation and his arrest. His burping\belching claims were in my view pure after-thought.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"/>115    Not only did he fail to show that his application of Bonjela gel more than two hours before he gave his breath sample had any effect on the breathalyser readings, Defence did not at all address how any residual Bonjela gel could have contributed to his excess breath alcohol concentration. This was not a case where a layman could reliably and confidently say that any residual Bonjela gel still present two hours later would have accounted for the breath alcohol concentration in excess of the prescribed limit. As regards the tooth-crack claim, the witnesses had testified that variables like the size of the crack was relevant to determine the amount of gel that could become trapped and consequently the mouth alcohol concentration. As regards the burping\belching claim, there was also no evidence as to the extent that any unabsorbed alcohol still remaining in the stomach two hours later would have elevated the breathalyser reading. Even if the accused had shown that residual Bonjela gel present more than two hours after his last application had elevated his breathalyser reading, no evidence had been led nor any submissions made as to the accused’s pre and post-event breath alcohol concentration to support his claim that had he not applied Bonjela gel after he stopped driving, his breath alcohol concentration would not have exceeded the prescribed limit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"/>116    All things considered, I convicted the accused as charged.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submission on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"/>117    The accused was a repeat drink-driving offender.

Under section 67(2) the accused shall also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 12 months from his conviction or from his release from imprisonment, unless the court thinks fit for special reasons to order otherwise.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Precedents citied</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"/>122    The difference in the prosecution and defence sentencing positions was that prosecution was seeking an imprisonment term of one week, fine of $1000, and disqualification of half-year more than what defence said was appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"/>123    Prosecution’s table of five precedent cases showed that for second-time drink-driving offenders who pleaded guilty and whose breath alcohol concentration ranged from 38 µg/ml to 81µg/ml, sentences of imprisonment had ranged from two to four weeks, with fines of $4000 to $7000 and disqualification orders of three to five years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"/>124    Counsel cited four cases of repeat drink-driving offenders whose breath alcohol concentration ranged from 61µg/ml to 136 µg/ml in plead-guilty cases.

They pointed to the present accused’s higher breath alcohol concentration (75 µg/ml compared to 65 µg/ml), his more recent drink-driving conviction ( three years compared to 14 years) and that he had claimed trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"/>128    Whilst these factors were indeed relevant, the court in <em>Alvin Kek</em> had noted that the offender had little choice but to plead guilty because of the overwhelming evidence, and the agreed facts were that the offender had driven the substantial distance of 15 km before entering the Woodlands Checkpoint in error: at [20] and Annex. The eventual sentence would have involved the qualitative weighing and balancing and interplay of all these relevant factors on a holistic assessment of the facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"/>129    As the High Court in <em>Edwin s\o Suse Nathan v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1139.xml')">[2013] 4 SLR 1139</a> (“<em>Edwin Suse Nathan</em>”) stated, there was a wide spectrum of facts involved in a section 67(1) RTA offence, and the court should first consider the extent to which the alcohol concentration exceeded the prescribed limit, as an offender with a higher concentration level was in more flagrant violation of the law and deserving of more severe punishment, before considering the aggravating and mitigation factors including the manner of driving and the danger\harm posed to other road users and his driving antecedents: at [16], [27] to [33].</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of Edwin Suse Nathan to the facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"/>130    As guided by <em>Edwin Suse Nathan</em>, I took into account the accused’s breath alcohol concentration of 75 µg/ml, which was 2.1 times the prescribed limit of 35 µg/ml. This would have put him in the third of the four bands in the <em>Edwin Suse Nathan</em> framework for first offenders: at [22]. In my view the level of intoxication should be regarded as in the above-moderate to high range.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"/>131    His previous conviction for drink-driving was also recent and specific deterrence would be a substantial sentencing consideration. He had been convicted on 25 February 2016, just three years prior to his current offence, and was sentenced to a fine of $3000 and disqualification order of 21 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"/>132    Counsel referred to <em>PP v Choo Kok Hwee</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0015.xml')">[2014] SGDC 15</a> (“<em>Choo Kok Hwee</em>’) where the accused’s breath alcohol concentration was also, like the present accused, 75 µg/ml,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> but whose offence defence said was more egregious.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"/>133    The offender in <em>Choo Kok Hwee</em> had been spotted by a police officer to be driving unsteadily. He was sentenced to three weeks imprisonment, fine of $6000 and disqualification of five years, with the court noting that the offence was committed while the accused was on police bail for an earlier drink-driving offence committed eight months earlier: at [15] and [17]. His previous conviction for drink-driving had been committed more than 24 years prior.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"/>134    Counsel submitted that unlike the offender in <em>Choo Kok Hwee</em>, in the present case the accused was in control of his vehicle and had driven his vehicle safely and did not exhibit any conduct amounting to dangerous or reckless driving and did not cause any damage to persons or property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"/>135    However even if it was accepted that the accused did not drive in an unsteady manner like the offender in <em>Choo Kok Hwee</em>, the absence of aggravating factors was not mitigating. Further compared to <em>Choo Kok Hwee</em>, the present accused’s previous drink-driving conviction was recent.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"/>136    The defence submission did not raise anything that carried mitigating weight. The accused had been arrested at the scene and failed his instant breathalyser tests, the evidence against him was overwhelming even if it was not disputed that he had been co-operative during his arrest.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"/>137    On the other hand, neither did I consider that there were any aggravating factors. Claiming trial was not an aggravating factor. I had also given the accused the benefit of the doubt on his claims about his manner of driving and that there were no circumstances that had increased the danger to other road users. According to the accused he had driven about two km home and was in control of his vehicle, and the in-camera video showed little vehicular or human traffic at that time of the night. The circumstances that led to the confrontation between PW4 the complainant and the accused at the carpark were not clearly established. Although the arresting officer PW1 testified that the complainant had told him at the scene that he was nearly knocked down by the accused, the curiously-forgetful complainant repeatedly claimed that he could not recall what led to the confrontation and he could not give any “confirmed answer” about whether he was nearly hit by the accused’s vehicle or not.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"/>138    In my view a sentence above the moderate range was appropriate. A substantial period of disqualification was warranted in this case. As the court in <em>Edwin Suse Nathan</em> observed, a driving disqualification order combines the three sentencing objectives of punishment, protection of the public and deterrence. The two components of a sentence of fine or jail and disqualification are not mutually compensatory and an increase in fine or jail should not be taken to mandate the imposition of a reduced period of disqualification: at [13].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"/>139    As the court in <em>Kwan Weiguang v PP</em> [2022] SGHC 121observed the imposition of disqualification takes effect above and beyond the primary sentence of an imprisonment term or fine, and a sufficiently lengthy disqualification order reminds an offender every day of his offence and that he is not permitted to drive because of his bad behavior. It was disqualification rather than a fine that a motorist fears most: at [59] to [62].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"/>140    All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of three weeks imprisonment, fine of $6000 (in default 12 days’ imprisonment) and a disqualification period of four years from the date of release was appropriate, and I sentenced the accused accordingly.</p>
