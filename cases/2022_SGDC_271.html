class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"/>1       This suit related to the sale of a 4.5 years old Mercedes S400 (“the Mercedes vehicle”) by the defendant to the plaintiff for the sale price of $212,500. As part of the same transaction, the plaintiff had traded in his 9 years old BMW 730Li (“the BMW vehicle”) to the defendant. Prior to the sale of the Mercedes vehicle, the plaintiff who is a director of Probuilt Construction &amp; Service Pte Ltd, was engaged by the defendant to carry out construction works at the defendant’s place of business at 5 Benoi Place, Singapore. Subsequently, as the plaintiff was unhappy with the Mercedes vehicle that he had purchased, he sued the defendant based on the tort of misrepresentation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       At the end of the trial, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. Being dissatisfied, the defendant has since appealed against my decision. These are the full grounds of my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       It was undisputed that the defendant had sold the Mercedes vehicle to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had traded in his BMW vehicle as part of the transaction. In addition, it was undisputed that the defendant also provided in- house financing through a Hire Purchase Agreement (“HPA”) to the plaintiff for purchase of the Mercedes vehicle in the sum of $106,761.20 for 35 months of instalments. The instalment plan was 34 months at $2,966 per month with a final instalment of $2,951.20. It was undisputed that the plaintiff had paid 7 monthly instalments of $2,966 between 9 September 2019 to 9 March 2020 before defaulting on the HPA.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s version</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       The plaintiff’s version was that Mr Neo Nam Heng (“NNH”) of the defendant made verbal representations to the plaintiff on 4<sup>th</sup> August 2019 and 16 August 2019 when the plaintiff attended at 5 Benoi Place, Singapore to monitor the progress of the construction works. Such representation had induced the plaintiff to purchase the Mercedes vehicle from the defendant through a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) dated 30 August 2019 for the sum of $212,500. The plaintiff pleaded in [4] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"/>a)     The Mercedes vehicle was used sparingly and was used to chauffer the senior Mr Neo until his death and that the vehicle had not been used since the death;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"/>b)     The vehicle was a 4.5 years old vehicle;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"/>c)     The vehicle had a mileage of 33,700km; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"/>d)     The plaintiff would be purchasing the vehicle at a “friendship price” given the good condition of the vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       Pursuant to the SPA, the plaintiff paid $114,500 by cash of $68,300 and trading in his BMW vehicle for the sum of $46,200. Relying upon the representation, the plaintiff also entered into the HPA with the defendant in which the defendant financed the remaining $98,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       According to the plaintiff, sometime around February 2020, he found a rental agreement dated 29 September 2017 evidencing that the Mercedes vehicle was rented out prior to the sale of the vehicle to the plaintiff. This rental agreement was located in the glove compartment of the vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       As the plaintiff was unhappy about this situation, he claimed that he demanded an explanation from Mr NNH. The plaintiff claimed that Mr NNH told him that he would check the defendant’s internal records about the rental of such vehicle and would revert. In the meantime, the plaintiff could withhold making payments under the HPA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       However, Mr NNH did not revert to the plaintiff Instead, the plaintiff claimed that 3 re-possession attempts were made by the defendant on 15 September 2020, 16 September 2020 and 14 October 2020.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       The plaintiff’s pleaded case was that his daughter, Ms Adeline Chiam Wei Min (“Ms Chiam”) then spoke to Mr Steve Neo of the defendant on 13 July 2020 over the telephone during which Mr Steve Neo admitted that the vehicle had been rented out prior to the sale to the plaintiff. According to the Chiams, Ms Chiam had been actively assisting the plaintiff in the matter since around the time the vehicle was purchased from the defendant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     On 30 October 2020, the defendant commenced DC/DC 2594/2020 against the plaintiff for the sum of $85,482.02 which was outstanding under the HPA. On 1 March 2021, the plaintiff paid $86,967.41 in full and final settlement of the HPA. On 22 March 2021, the plaintiff sold the Mercedes Vehicle for the sum of $159,888 through another dealer.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s version</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     The defendant’s version was straightforward. It denied that such verbal representations were made including the alleged representation in February/March 2020 to the effect that the plaintiff could withhold making payments pending Mr NNH’s investigation into the rental vehicle issue.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     The defendant did not dispute that the Mercedes vehicle was rented out prior to its sale to the plaintiff. The defendant also did not dispute that a Notice to Re-possess dated 3 July 2020 was issued. It also agreed that the sum of $86,967.41 was paid to resolve DC/DC 2594/2020.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be determined </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     The issues before the court were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>Issue 1- Was the defendant liable for the alleged misrepresentation as claimed by the plaintiff?</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>Issue 2- Assuming that there was misrepresentation made by the defendant, did the plaintiff suffer any loss?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the court</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1- Was the defendant liable for the alleged misrepresentation as claimed by the plaintiff? </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     The law on fraudulent misrepresentation is trite. The plaintiff has to establish:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"/>a.     Representation of fact by words or conduct;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"/>b.     Made with intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"/>c.     Made with knowledge of its falsity or in absence of any genuine belief that it is true;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"/>d.     Which the plaintiff acted on; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"/>e.     The plaintiff has suffered damage.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     As for the plaintiff’s claim for negligent misrepresentation under section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, Rev Ed), he has to establish that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"/>a.     The defendant made false representation of fact;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"/>b.     Which induced reliance; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"/>c.     Caused damage to the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     In [4] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1), the plaintiff pleaded that there had been verbal representation allegedly made by Mr NNH of the defendant on 4<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> August 2019. I discerned from the pleadings and the plaintiff’s evidence in court that in essence, his main unhappiness if not the only unhappiness, was that Mr NNH had informed the plaintiff that the Mercedes vehicle was used to ferry senior Mr Neo around when he was alive and the vehicle had not been utilised since the death and Mr NNH did not inform the plaintiff that the Mercedes was rented out during the period after the death of senior Mr Neo to the time of its sale to the plaintiff. In short, the plaintiff’s main unhappiness was that the Mercedes vehicle was rented out prior to its sale to the plaintiff and being a former rental vehicle, there would be safety issues. According to the plaintiff, this lack of information about the Mercedes vehicle having been rented out before its sale to the plaintiff amounted to misrepresentation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     The plaintiff conceded during cross examination that the rest of the representation in [4b] to [4d] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) were true. As for [4d] about the friendship price of $212,500, the plaintiff conceded that he had found from vehicle advertisements that the price of a similar vehicle was $226,000 which meant that he had bought the Mercedes vehicle at a significant discount.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     I shall now focus on the remaining [4a] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) which was the plaintiff’s main unhappiness as outlined earlier. To recapitulate, this was the issue about the defendant’s alleged failure in not informing the plaintiff about the usage of the vehicle after the death of senior Mr Neo; in particular, that it was a rental vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     I found that the defendant was not liable for the alleged misrepresentation. It was undisputed that there was no mention of the Mercedes vehicle being a rental vehicle prior to its sale to the plaintiff. It was also undisputed that the vehicle was a rental vehicle prior to its sale to the plaintiff as per the rental agreement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> . The agreement was evidence of the rental of this vehicle to one Cargotec CHS Pte Ltd from 29 September 2017 to 29 April 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     I accepted the defendant’s evidence that Mr NNH did not make the representation as pleaded in [4] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) at all. This would be consistent with the undisputed fact that he did not make any representation about the Mercedes Vehicle being a rental vehicle prior to its sale to the plaintiff. This was unsurprising as Mr NNH being the Chairman of a Case Trust company, which is in the business of selling and renting out hundreds if not thousands of vehicles, would not personally make such representation to sell this one vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     It was undisputed that in this suit, alleged misrepresentation, if any, was oral and the plaintiff bore the burden of proof that such misrepresentation were made by Mr NNH as pleaded. The plaintiff’s counsel had asked the court to draw an adverse inference under section 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1990) against the defendant for its failure to call Mr NNH as he was a critical witness. I declined to do so as there was adequate evidence from other witnesses and the defendant’s pleaded case was simply that Mr NNH denied having made such representation. This meant that the plaintiff was seeking for the defendant to prove a negative when the burden of proof was with the plaintiff to prove a positive in that such misrepresentation was made.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     I found the plaintiff to be less than truthful in his evidence to the court. One example was the plaintiff claiming that the BMW vehicle had to be towed when being traded in because one or more tyres had been punctured. I found this assertion not to be credible when a more logical behaviour would be to replace the punctured tyre rather than having the BMW vehicle towed. Another example was changing his evidence in court about the condition of the Mercedes vehicle when he test drove the vehicle. Initially, he testified that he found the vehicle condition to be very good. Subsequently he changed his evidence to “only okay.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     There were other instances in which I found the plaintiff to be less than truthful. He embellished his case by claiming at [60] of his AEIC that he did not use much of the Mercedes vehicle for fear of safety after discovering that it was a rental vehicle. It was undisputed that the plaintiff had sent the Mercedes vehicle for servicing at MBM Wheelpower (“MBM”) when he had possession of the vehicle. Contrary to the plaintiff’s claim that he did not use the vehicle much due to fear of safety, I found that he proceeded to use the vehicle quite often as evidenced by the mileage captured in the 2 MBM service invoices<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and the Sale agreement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> when the plaintiff sold off the vehicle. The plaintiff’s usage of the Mercedes vehicle as evidenced in these contemporaneous documents has been summarised in the table below:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.54%"/><col width="49.46%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Document</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mileage (km)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">When the plaintiff first bought the Mercedes vehicle on 30 August 2019</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">33,700</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1<sup>st</sup> MBM invoice dated 9 December 2019</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38,593</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2<sup>nd</sup> MBM invoice dated 7 April 2020</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">45,961</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sale agreement dated 21 March </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2021</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">55,000</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     As can be seen in the data re-produced in the table above, the plaintiff used the vehicle to travel approximately 21,000 km in the 18 months when the vehicle was in his possession. This was an average of 14,000 km per year which could hardly be considered low usage of the vehicle. I shall elaborate more later.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     Another example of the plaintiff’s lack of truthfulness was when he claimed that he did nothing about the notice of repossession<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and letter of demand<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> but yet he proceeded to send an email to the defendant subsequently<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. He also claimed that he did not attempt to sell the Mercedes Vehicle through Pauline of the defendant when there were WhatsApp messages clearly evidencing the same <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     The plaintiff’s justification in holding unto the vehicle was also inconsistent. The plaintiff gave oral evidence in court that for the 3 failed re-possession attempts that occurred on 15 September 2020, 16 September 2020 and 14 October 2020 due to his failure to service the HPA instalments since April 2020, he would have allowed the re-possession if proper documents were shown to him. However, Ms Chiam testified that they did not allow the Mercedes vehicle to be re-possessed because Mr NNH said he was looking into the rental vehicle issues and told them they could hold unto the Mercedes vehicle pending Mr NNH’s investigation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     I found it rather curious that the Chiams did not obtain such alleged assurances made by Mr NNH in writing given that since July 2020, parties’ relationship had deteriorated as evidenced by the acrimonious teleconversation between Mr Steve Neo and Ms Chiam on 13 July 2020. As there was nothing in writing except the Chiams’ words for it, I found that the plaintiff had not proven such assurances were made by Mr NNH about looking into the rental issue as alleged by Ms Chiam. In any case, the plaintiff had unconditionally paid the balance outstanding HPA sum prior to selling the Mercedes vehicle through another dealer.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     Since I had earlier found that Mr NNH did not make the alleged representation, the remaining issue to be addressed was whether the defendant’s silence about the Mercedes vehicle being a rental one amounted to misrepresentation. I found that this silence about the Mercedes vehicle having been a rental vehicle did not amount to misrepresentation. It is trite that silence generally is not misrepresentation. In <em>Trans-World (Aluminium) Ltd v Cornelder China (Singapore)</em> [2003] 3 SLR (R) 501, the court held that misrepresentation by silence entails more than mere silence and requires that there had been a wilful suppression of material and important facts which would therefore render any statements made untrue. Similarly in <em>Larkin, Christian Alfred and another v Kaikhushru Shiavax Nargowala and another</em> [2022] SGHC (I) 4, misrepresentation by silence entails active concealment of a particular state of affairs with dishonest intent such as wilful suppression of material and important facts that would render a statement untrue.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     I found that there was no wilful suppression nor active concealment on the part of the defendant in this suit. It was a situation where the plaintiff simply did not enquire whether the Mercedes vehicle was rented out before its sale to the plaintiff when he should have done so if such a fact was important to him. It was undisputed that the plaintiff did not ask for such information before and around the time of sale of the vehicle to the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     The plaintiff did not provide any logical and reasonable explanation to the court as to why he did not ascertain this information when he could have easily done so. I found that the plaintiff would more likely than not be alive to the possibility that the some of the vehicles sold by the defendant might be rental vehicles including the Mercedes vehicle. As the plaintiff had conducted renovation works of the defendant’s office at Benoi place, he would clearly be aware that the defendant is in the business of selling new and used vehicles as well as leasing out vehicles. In addition, the name of the defendant is “Prime Motor &amp; Leasing Pte Ltd” with emphasis on the word “Leasing” in its name. I found that if the plaintiff was genuinely concerned that it was a rental vehicle and this was an important fact to him, he could have enquired from a number of people working in the defendant company; namely, Mr NNH, Mr Steve Neo or sales staff Jack Ng. But he did not do so.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     The plaintiff urged this court to impose a duty to disclose such information on the defendant. However, I agreed with the defendant that to do so would be tantamount to imposing a duty where there was none. I accepted the evidence of Mr Steve Neo, who is experienced in the vehicle trade, that the most important factors for a customer seeking to buy a used vehicle were price, mileage and whether the vehicle had been in an accident before. Further, there was no requirement to point out every single detail save that they must answer the customer’s questions truthfully. As the plaintiff had the burden of proof and had not produced a witness nor a case authority in support in a vehicle sale context to support his position that there was such a duty on the part of the defendant, I found in favour of the defendant on this score.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     In short, the plaintiff had not proven that there was wilful suppression of material and important facts in particular, that the subject vehicle was a rental vehicle. Instead, the plaintiff attributed blame on the defendant by stating in [19] of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) that the defendant did not follow its practice by informing customers that the subject vehicle had been a rental vehicle. The plaintiff had not produced proof to substantiate this assertion that the practice existed and the defendant had departed from such a practice.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     Even taking the plaintiff’s case at its highest in that the court should impose such a duty on the defendant to disclose that the subject vehicle was a rental one and that silence could amount to misrepresentation on the part of the defendant, I found that there was a strong likelihood that the plaintiff had bought the Mercedes vehicle due to other factors which he had found very attractive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     It is trite that there must be a causal link between the plaintiff’s reliance on the misrepresentation and the misrepresentation must have induced the plaintiff to enter into the contract. And whether this is the case is a question of fact. The authority in support is “The Law of Contract in Singapore” by Andrew Phang , Academy Publishing, 2012<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. Similarly, in <em>Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG v Archer Daniels Midland Co and others</em> [2007] 1 SLR (R) 196, the court opined that inducement is a question of fact and the burden of proving is at all times on the representee.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     As stated earlier, I accepted the evidence of Mr Steve Neo that the most important factors for a customer of a used vehicle were price, mileage and whether the vehicle had been in an accident before. I found that the plaintiff had bought the Mercedes vehicle based on these 3 factors. The plaintiff bought the Mercedes vehicle because the vehicle was sold below market price at $212,500 when a similar vehicle was advertised at $226,000. Further, the plaintiff testified that he knew the defendant was a “Case Trust” company which meant that it has a very good reputation in the used vehicles market. The plaintiff testified that he found the mileage of 33,700 km to be low for a vehicle of the age when it was sold to the plaintiff. Generally, the performance of an used vehicle during a test drive might be indicative of it condition including the possibility of whether it had been involved in an accident before. In this regard, the plaintiff testified in court that he found the vehicle condition to be “very good” when he test drove it although he later changed his evidence to “only okay”. The Mercedes vehicle had clearly performed well to his satisfaction during the test drive as by his own admission, he had driven the vehicle for about 50km by driving it on a return trip from Benoi Place to his residence at Seletar. Consequently, he proceeded to purchase the vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     By the plaintiff’s own evidence, he discovered that the Mercedes vehicle was a rental vehicle in April 2020. But contemporaneous evidence revealed that the first complaint was raised by the plaintiff only in July 2020 which was 3 months later. This surfaced in Ms Chiam’s teleconversation with Steve Neo on 13 July 2020. I found that this was curious behaviour for someone who claimed to be very upset about discovering that the Mercedes vehicle had been a rental vehicle prior to its sale to the plaintiff. The Chiams claimed that they confronted Mr NNH prior to July 2020 and was told to keep the vehicle and withhold making instalment payments. I found these assertions to be bare ones that had not been substantiated. The plaintiff’s behaviour contradicted such an assertion. If the plaintiff was merely following the defendant’s advice to keep the vehicle without making instalment payments, why did the plaintiff attempt to sell the vehicle through Pauline of the defendant company in March 2020? Such attempts made by the plaintiff to sell the Mercedes vehicle had borne out by the contemporaneous WhatsApp messages between Pauline and Jack<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     In summary, I found that the price, mileage and condition of the vehicle were the factors that had induced the plaintiff to go ahead with the purchase. The plaintiff claimed to be unhappy with the fact that it was a rental vehicle and therefore had a high mileage. I doubt that this was true as seen from the plaintiff’s behaviour. As rightly pointed by the defendant in its closing submissions at [104] to [106], the plaintiff had extensively used the Mercedes vehicle despite claiming to be unhappy with it. He clocked 21,000 km mileage using the vehicle during a 18 months ownership and possession which meant he clocked an average of 14,000 km a year. In contrast, in terms of the mileage clocked before its sale to the plaintiff, the vehicle had a mileage of 33,700 km when it was sold as a 4.5 years old vehicle which meant that the average mileage was only 7,489km a year prior to its sale to the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2- Assuming that there was misrepresentation made by the defendant, did the plaintiff suffer any loss?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     At this juncture, there is no necessity for this court to go further. For completeness, I shall do so. Even if the plaintiff had proven his case for the first issue, I found that the plaintiff had not proven that he suffered a loss. I shall explain the reasons for my finding.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     The plaintiff suffered no loss by paying $212,500 for the Mercedes vehicle as by his own evidence in court, he did market research and found that a similar vehicle was advertised for $226,000. The plaintiff also did not adduce any evidence to show that he had overpaid for the vehicle in that the vehicle price should be much lower due to it being a rental vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     I found that the plaintiff did not sell the vehicle at a loss to another buyer upon discovering that the subject vehicle was previously rented out. According to Mr Steve Neo, the normal rate the depreciation for such vehicles was $50,000-$60,000 for the first year and $35,000-$40,000 for subsequent years up to 7<sup>th</sup> or 8th year. I accepted this evidence to be correct in that this was the normal rate of depreciation for a vehicle of this make and model as Mr Steve Neo runs the defendant’s companies and oversees sale of new and used vehicles. Given the nature of his work, he would be familiar with depreciation of vehicles. Mr Steve Neo’s evidence on the rate of depreciation was not challenged by the plaintiff in court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     The Mercedes vehicle was bought at $212,500 in September 2019 and sold some 18 months in March 2021 at $159,888 by the plaintiff. This was a difference of $52,612. This worked out to an annual depreciation of approximately $35,741 for the period of the plaintiff’s ownership of the vehicle. As the Mercedes vehicle was 4.5 to 6 years old during the time when it was in the possession of the plaintiff, the normal rate of depreciation would have been $$35,000 to $40,000. As the depreciation rate for the Mercedes vehicle was $35,741, this fell within the range of normal rate of depreciation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     I found that the plaintiff was unable to articulate the computation of his claim and this inability extended to being unable to quantify why he claimed $50,000 that was reflected in his former lawyer M/s Gavan Law Practice’s letter of demand of 1 October 2020. He was also not able to clearly explain the computation of his loss as quantified in his AEIC when cross-examined in court. I agreed with the defendant that based on the plaintiff’s computation, the plaintiff was effectively seeking for free usage of the Mercedes vehicle for the 18 months period when he owned and possessed the Mercedes vehicle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     In M/s Gavan Law Practice’s letter of demand, the plaintiff sought payment of $50,000 from the defendant. As rightly pointed out by the defendant’s counsel in court, rental of this vehicle was $5,600 per month as at April 2019 as reflected in the rental agreement with Cargotec CHS Pte Ltd. This meant that for the 18 months period when the plaintiff owned and possessed the vehicle, he had derived a benefit worth $100,800 ($5,600 per month x 18 months=$100,800). This benefit was clearly not factored into the plaintiff’s quantification of his alleged loss. This amount far exceeded the damages of $63,000 that the plaintiff sought as stated in his AEIC. In fact, the plaintiff even unfairly quantified the benefit as $2,722 per month instead of $5,600 per month in his letter<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. Even if the rental price was reduced due to aging, surely the rental worth cannot be 50% of its previous rental value in a matter of months. In any case, the plaintiff did not exhibit any proof of this assertion of $2,722 per month rental value other than the bare assertion that this figure was based on research done by the plaintiff.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     For the above reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim.
