id="p1_1"/>1       The accused, Niranjan s/o Muthupalani (“the accused” or “Niranjan”), pleaded guilty to two charges under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) for voluntarily causing hurt (“VCH”) to two different people at about 1850 hours at “Stickies Bar” located at 50 Tagore Lane, #05-07,Singapore 787494 (“the bar”). Three similar charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       As the accused was a person subject to supervision under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Chapter 67, 2000 Rev. Ed.) (“CLTPA”) and the offence of VCH is a scheduled offence under the Third Schedule to the CLTPA, he was thereby liable to enhanced punishment under s 35 of the CLTPA.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       I will proceed to set out the chronology of events in this matter:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"/>(a)     On 26 August 2022, the accused pleaded guilty to the two VCH charges. He understood the nature and consequences of his plea. The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. He also admitted and consented to three similar charges to be TIC. After having heard the Prosecution’s Skeletal Sentencing Submissions (“PSSS”) and the Defence’s Plea in Mitigation (“PIM”), I adjourned the matter to 12 September 2022 for sentencing. It should be noted that all the five charges were classified as Magistrate’s Court Notices (“MCN”) at this stage;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"/>(b)     On 12 September 2022. the accused was sentenced to a global sentence of three months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment. The accused was allowed to defer his sentence until 27 September 2022 and his bail was extended accordingly. After the accused had left the courtroom, it came to my attention that, as the accused was subject to enhanced punishment under s 35 of the CLTPA, he was now liable to be punished to a term of imprisonment of up to six years. Accordingly, this brought the matter beyond the jurisdiction a Magistrate to try.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"/>(c)     Later on the same day, I saw the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) and Defence Counsel parties <em>via</em> Zoom. We were unable to contact the accused. The Defence had no objection to the charge being amended from an MCN charge to a District Court Notice (“DCN”) charge. Unfortunately, as the accused had already been convicted for the offences on 26 August 2022, the DPP was unable refile any amended charge in the Integrated Criminal Management System (“ICMS”). Both parties agreed that that therefore, the court should record a retraction of the accused’s guilty plea to allow the charges to be amended from MCN to DCN charges. On 27 September 2022, the date of the accused’s scheduled surrender, the court will then re-enter the accused’s guilty plea. As such, at the present time, a retraction of the accused’s guilty plea was accordingly recorded in ICMS;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"/>(d)     On 27 September 2022, the case was re-mentioned with the charges having been amended from MCN to DCN. I first explained to the accused what had transpired after the previous plead guilty mention. The accused reaffirmed his plea of guilty and reconfirmed that the SOF were correct. After reconfirming the Prosecution’s sentencing position and the Defence’s plea in mitigation and sentencing submission, I proceeded to sentence the accused to a global sentence of three months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment. The individual sentences are set out below:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_i"/>(i)       DCN 900157 of 2022: three months’ imprisonment; and</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_3-p2_d-p3_ii"/>(ii)       DCN 900156 of 2022: two weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_e"/>(e)     The accused filed a Notice of Appeal against sentence on the same day. He is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts of the case</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       The accused admitted to the SOF without qualification.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       The accused is a Criminal Law Police Supervisee (“CLPS”) and was placed on police supervision pursuant to an order made by the Minister for Home Affairs under ss 30(1) and 33(1) of the CLTPA for a period of three years beginning on 9 May 2019, <em>vide</em> a Police Supervision Order (“PSO”). The accused was informed of the restrictions placed upon him when he was placed under police supervision. The PSO was varied on 30 December 2019 and changes to the restrictions were imposed. However, the duration of the PSO was not altered or amended.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       On the evening of 13 March 2020, the accused, together with his girlfriend, Sharon Auxilia (“W1”) went for drinks at the bar. Also present at the bar that evening were the two victims, namely A Gopinath (“V1”) and Chong Jui Jing Kenneth (“V2”) and the victims’ colleagues, Richard Burnen s/o Mahandrian (“W2”), Ong Yeow Hwee Glenn (“W3”), and Han Min Da (“W4”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       At about 1850 hours, the accused had a misunderstanding with V1 near the smoking corner. The accused and V1 exchanged vulgarities, following which the accused started to assault V1 by punching and kicking him. V1 did not retaliate. During the assault on V1, the accused also slapped V2 at least once in the face when he attempted to intervene.

These aggravating factors were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>The accused initiated the assault</u>. Although V1 had uttered vulgarities at him, it was the accused who initiated the assault by punching and kicking V1;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>The manner which the harm was inflicted</u>. The accused continuously assaulted V1 for approximately four minutes,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> only stopping occasionally to deal with interventions from the witnesses.

Five different individuals (V2 and W1 to W4) had attempted to stop the accused from assaulting V1. Instead, the accused threatened and was violent towards them. This resulted in noticeable injuries to three of them;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"/>(d)      <u>Similar TIC charges</u> – There are an additional three TIC charges<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> which are of the same nature as those in the proceeded charges. The similar nature of the TIC charges would warrant an enhancement to the sentence (per <em>PP v UI</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0500.xml')">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500</a> at [38]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     The Prosecution therefore proposed an uplift of two months’ imprisonment to give an indicative sentence of between four to five months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   A further uplift in sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     As the accused was liable for enhanced punishment under s 35 of the CLTPA, being on police supervision under the CLTPA when the offences were committed. As a result, the punishment prescribed by law was twice the punishment prescribed by law for a VCH offence, namely six years’ instead of three years’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that the sentence should therefore be enhanced by an additional month.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Mitigating factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     The Prosecution was of the view that the only mitigating factor was the accused’s early plea of guilt and submitted that a downward adjustment of one month was warranted. Hence the final sentence submitted by the Prosecution for the offence of VCH against V1 was four months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Precedent cases</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     It was submitted that this sentence was consistent with precedent cases. In <em>PP v Yong Chee Meng (Yang Zhiming)</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20437-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGMC 36</a> <em>(“Yong Chee Meng”</em>), the offender pleaded guilty to and was convicted of three charges including, an offence of VCH. This was decided prior to the 2020 amendment which increased the punishment prescribed by law from two to three years’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     The victim noticed that the offender and his friend had been smoking as they came out of the lift and he said, <em>“mother fucker smoking inside the lift</em>”. Hearing that, the offender’s friend attacked the victim by punching and kicking the victim. The offender then joined in. The victim suffered soft tissue injury. The offender was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment. The district court held (at [35]) that the offender’s actions deserved an imprisonment term of two to three months imprisonment, but the individual sentence was reduced to one month’s imprisonment as the district judge (“DJ”) intended to run the sentence for the VCH offence consecutively to the other two sentences against the accused. Additionally, the offender in <em>Yong Chee Meng</em> was traced for an offence of VCH, it was viewed as a dated antecedent and thus accorded minimal weight by the DJ in this respect.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">For the VCH offence against V2</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     V2 suffered a contusion wound over his left cheek and chipped (or fractured) teeth. He was given three days medical leave and was referred to the Dental Polyclinic.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     The Prosecution assessed the harm caused to V2 as being low. This would place the offence in Band 1 of the <em>Low Song Chye</em> sentencing framework. However, it was submitted that the custodial threshold was crossed. The fractured teeth were permanent and would not heal over time. Hence, the appropriate indicative starting point was one weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     It was submitted that the following factors would warrant an uplift of an additional one weeks’ imprisonment. These were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>Unprovoked assault</u>. The punching of V2 was one-sided and unprovoked. V2 was punched because he had tried to intervene;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>TIC charges</u>. The accused’s TIC charges were similar in nature, and it demonstrated a need for the sentence to be enhanced;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"/>(c)      <u>On police supervision</u>. The accused is facing enhanced sentence under s 35 of the CLTPA.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Consecutive sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     The Prosecution submitted that sentences in respect of related offences should be run concurrently (<em>per</em> Sunderesh Menon CJ in <em>Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16232-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] 2 SLR 998</a> (“<em>Mohamad Shoufee’</em>) at [27] – [46]). In the present case, whilst the offences were committed within a short period of time, the two offences committed against V1 and V2 reflected distinct acts of criminality committed by the against separate victims.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     Therefore, the Prosecution submitted that the two sentences of imprisonment should run consecutively, for a global sentence of at least four months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plea in mitigation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     In contrast, the Defence sought the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"/>(a)     For the court to call for a Probation Suitability Report (“PSR”) to assess the accused’s suitability for probation; or in the alternative,</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"/>(b)     A global sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment. The individual sentences being eight weeks’ imprisonment for the VCH offence against V1 and a one weeks’ imprisonment term of the VCH offence against V2, with both sentences to run concurrently.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Probation suitability report</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     It was submitted that the accused was eligible for probation under s 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed) (“POA”). Although the accused was above the age of 21, he had demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform and there were exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation (per [34], <em>A Karthik v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a> (“<em>Karthik</em>”).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>Strong propensity for reform</u>. The accused was untraced except for the PSO. He had “key protective scaffolds” to aid his rehabilitation in the form of his family and his girlfriend. The accused was presently seeing a psychotherapist for his mental condition ie. Intermittent Explosive Disorder (“IED”). The accused has remained crime free since the incident;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Exceptional circumstances</u>.

Instead, it was submitted that any uplift should be applied at the second stage of the <em>Low Song Chye</em> sentencing framework, where an offender’s culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors are considered.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     The Defence proposed the following sentences for the offences,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> based on the fact that there was no premeditation or deliberation, that the victims were not especially vulnerable, that no weapon was used, that it was not a group assault and that the accused had no relevant antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>For the VCH offence against V1</u>.

It does not appear to me that he has acknowledged that he was responsible for his own actions. He has put the blame on the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>The victims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></u> The accused had asserted that he was provoked by V1. Perhaps V1 did so. However, the CCTV footage clearly showed that the accused was the aggressive party throughout. He repeatedly punched V1 and even kicked him. V1 never retaliated at all. It is ironic that he now blames V1 for his prolonged aggressive act. I note also that he has not apologised to the victims, in particular V2, who was hurt by the accused only because he was trying to stop him;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Mental illness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></u> The accused blamed his mental condition, namely IED, as contributing to his commission of the offence;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"/>(c)      <u>Alcohol.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></u> He likewise blames alcohol as contributing to his commission of the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     Although one could say that the accused has not committed any offences since the commission of the present offences, I did not place much weight on this despite the fact that the offence occurred 30 months before he was eventually sentenced. The accused was charged about a year after the incident, and it was through no fault of the Prosecution that took another 18 months before the case was finally disposed of.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether there were exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     The Defence highlighted the forensic medical report (“MR”) prepared by one Dr Jacob Rajesh (“Dr Rajesh”) dated 20 June 2022 in which Dr Rajesh was of the opinion that the IED suffered by the accused was a major contributory factor in his offending.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     As helpfully pointed out by the Prosecution, Dr Rajesh not only highlighted that IED had a contributory link to the offence, he had also opined that alcohol had a contributory link in the commission of the offence. At [23] of the MR, we are informed that the accused, whilst at the bar, drank 10 to 15 glasses of vodka and some beer, not an insubstantial amount. In my view, the alcohol would have contributed as much to the commission of the offence. It my mind, there were no exceptional circumstances that warranted the calling for a PSR.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     Lastly, it must be remembered that the accused was placed on a PSO. Although the SOF does not allude to the reason why the accused had been placed on a PSO, Dr Rajesh’s MR at[13] gives us one. Namely, that the accused had been involved in secret society activities.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     At the end of the day, I was of the view that Probation was not an appropriate sentence in the present case and accordingly, I declined to call for a PSR.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing considerations for the offence of VCH</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The indicative starting sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     In <em>Low Song Chye</em> at [77], the High Court prescribed three broad sentencing bands providing indicative sentencing ranges based on the hurt caused by the offence. These bands are for a first-time offender who has pleaded guilty. These bands have already been set out at [14], above, however, for convenience, I have reproduced the bands below:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.7%"/><col width="49.96%"/><col width="33.34%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Band</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Hurt caused</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Indicative Sentencing Range</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Low harm</b>: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or custodial term up to 4 weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Moderate harm</b>: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function.</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 4 weeks’ and 6 months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p> </td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Serious harm</b>: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 6 months and 24 months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     With effect from 1 January 2020, the maximum imprisonment term prescribed by law for VCH has since increased from two to three years’ imprisonment, representing an increase of 1.5 times. Hence, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing bands in <em>Low Song Chye</em> should likewise be increased 1.5 times.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     The Defence urged the court not to adopt this “mere arithmetic approach” proposed by the Prosecution. The Defence cited the Penal Code Review Committee Report (August 2018) with stated that the legislative intent for the amendments was “ <em>,,,,, for general benchmarks for s 323 offences to be increased across the board, to allow for </em><em><u>the full spectrum of aggravating factors </u></em><em>to be taken into account across the entire sentencing range.</em>”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     The Defence further submitted that any new or revised sentencing framework should be left to the appellate court (per <em>Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22201-SSP.xml')">[2018] 2 SLR 557</a> (“<em>Kalnagie</em>”) at [67]) and instead, any uplift should be applied at the second stage of the analysis under the <em>Low Song Chye</em> framework, wherein the offender’s culpability, and the aggravating and mitigation factors are considered to make adjustment from the indicative starting sentence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     I disagreed with the Defence. The Court of Appeal’s guidance in <em>Kalangie</em> at [67] was making reference to the formulation of <em>new</em> sentencing frameworks. In the present case, there is no new sentencing framework to speak of. The sentencing framework has already been laid down by the High Court. The revised sentencing framework proposed by the Prosecution, on the other hand, does fulfil the legislative intent. It increases the ranges of the various sentencing bands. This will allow the court to utilize the full spectrum of the punishment prescribed by law, whilst at the same time, allowing the court to take into account the full extent of any aggravating and mitigating factors that may be present.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"/>53     I therefore accepted the Prosecution’s proposed revised sentencing band. For convenience, this is also reproduced below:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.7%"/><col width="49.96%"/><col width="33.34%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Band</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Hurt caused</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Revised Indicative Sentencing Range</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Low harm</b>: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or custodial term up to 6 weeks’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Moderate harm</b>: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 6 weeks’ and 9 months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p> </td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Serious harm</b>: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 9 months and 36 months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"/>54     Based on the revised <em>Low Song Chye</em> sentencing framework, the following are my assessment of the indicative starting sentences:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>For the VCH offence against V1</u>. Both the Prosecution and the Defence have assessed this offence as coming within Band 2, giving a sentencing range of between 6 weeks’ to nine months’ imprisonment. However, the Prosecution had assessed the <em>indicative starting sentence</em> at between two to three months’ imprisonment with the Defence assessing the same at six to eight weeks’ imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> I agreed that, based on the injuries suffered by V1, this offence would fall within Band 2 of the framework. I was, however, not convinced that the indicative starting sentence should be as high as submitted by the Prosecution. Instead, I adjudged that the indicative starting sentence to be just slightly above the very low end of Band 2, namely seven weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>For the VCH offence against V2.</u> Likewise, both the Prosecution and the Defence have assessed this offence as coming within Band 1 and both have assessed the indicative starting point to be one weeks’ imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> I did not disagree with the assessment. I according adjudged the indicative starting point for the VCH offence against V2 at one weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Adjustments to the indicative starting point</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"/>55     In the second stage of the enquiry in the <em>Low Song Chye</em> sentencing framework, the court is to make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"/>56     The following are my adjustments to the indicative starting sentences for the offences against V1 and V2.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Adjustments to the indicative starting sentence for the VCH offence against V1</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"/>57     I agreed with the Prosecution that there were factors in the present case that would increase the accused’s culpability. These are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"/>(a)     Even if it was accepted that V1 had uttered vulgarities at the accused, there is no excuse for the accused’s actions. It is very clear that it was the accused who had initiated the assault. He not only punched V1, but he also kicked him;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"/>(b)     I agreed with the Prosecution that the manner of the assault was also brutal. V1 was continuously assaulted for about four minutes. At no time did V1 retaliate. In fact, the accused had continued his assault even after V1 had dropped to the floor. It was indeed fortuitous that V1 was not more seriously hurt;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_c"/>(c)     Other individuals, W2, W3, W4 and V2 had attempted to stop the accused from assaulting V1, but to no avail. Instead, the accused had threatened and hurt them, including V2;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_d"/>(d)     The accused also faced three TIC charges of a similar nature to the proceeded charges, namely causing hurt to W2, W3 and W4.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"/>58     The Prosecution had assessed this uplift at two months’ imprisonment. I disagreed. Instead, I assessed that the uplift at this stage to be four weeks’ imprisonment. This gave an indicative sentence, at this stage, of eleven weeks’ imprisonment for the VCH offence against V1.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Adjustments to the indicative starting sentence for the VCH offence against V2</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"/>59     The Prosecution submitted that an uplift of one weeks’ imprisonment for this offence would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"/>60     The only aggravating factor in the present case was that V2 was hurt only because he was trying to stop the accused from assaulting V1. With regard to the TIC charges, I had already considered the TIC charges when determining the uplift for the VCH offence against V1, I was therefore of the view that I should not consider that factor here as this would be double counting the TIC charges as an aggravating factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"/>61     Hence, I considered that only a marginal uplift would be appropriate. I assessed this to be about four days’ imprisonment, giving an indicative sentence of 11 days’ imprisonment at this stage.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Police Supervision Order</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"/>62     There is no third stage in the <em>Low Song Chye</em> sentencing framework. However, as the accused was on a PSO at the time of the offence, I proceeded to consider this as the third stage of the analysis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"/>63     At the material time, the accused was liable to enhanced punishment under s 35 of the CLTPA as the offence of VCH is a scheduled offence under the Third Schedule to the CLTPA. This meant that the maximum imprisonment term prescribed by law for an offence of VCH is doubled from three to six years.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"/>64     With regard to the VCH offence against V1, the Prosecution submitted that an uplift of one months’ imprisonment would be appropriate while the Defence submitted that there be no uplift.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"/>65     In this respect, I disagreed with the Defence. The fact that Parliament saw fit to double the punishment prescribed by law for offenders who committed offences of violence while on PSO clearly showed that such offences should be more severely dealt with. The only issue would the length of the uplift imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"/>66     In determining the length of the uplift, I considered the following factors:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>Nature of the offence committed</u>. The offences that attract the enhanced punishment under s 35 of the CLTPA are offences of violence. In comparison to the other offences in the Third Schedule, the offence of VCH is not one of the more serious offences envisaged;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>When the offence was committed</u>. The PSO was issued to the accused on 9 May 2019. The order was for a duration of three years. He would have been reminded of this on 30 December 2019, when the PSO was varied and changes to the restrictions were imposed. Less than a year into the PSO, and less than four months after the PSO was varied, the accused breached one of the conditions of his PSO by committing this offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"/>67     I therefore adjudged that the proposed uplift of one months’ imprisonment by the Prosecution for the VCH offence against V1 was fair and appropriate in the circumstances. Hence, the indicative sentence for the two VCH offences at this stage are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>The VCH offence against V1</u>. The indicative sentence at this stage is 15 weeks’ imprisonment, being the total of the three stages described above, namely, seven weeks (1<sup>st</sup> stage – step one of <em>Low Song Chye</em>), four weeks’ (2<sup>nd</sup> stage – step two of <em>Low Song Chye</em>) and four weeks’ (3<sup>rd</sup> stage – uplift for enhanced punishment);</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>The VCH offence against V2</u>. I Adjudged that the uplift for this offence would be similar to that against V1, in percentage terms. Hence, the indicative sentence at this stage is assessed at 15 days’ imprisonment, being the total of the three stages, namely, one week (1<sup>st</sup> stage), four days’ (2<sup>nd</sup> stage) and now, four days’ (3<sup>rd</sup> stage)</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mitigating factors considered</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"/>68     Having determined the indicative sentences, I next proceeded to consider the mitigating factors present. While I accepted that there were mitigating factors present, the weight that I have placed on them are perhaps not as much as what the Defence would like me to.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"/>69     Amongst the mitigating factors I took into account are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>Mental illness</u>. As I have alluded to earlier in these grounds, whilst the accused could be said to be suffering from IED, I have much doubt as how much it contributed to the offence as the presence of alcohol, in my view, also contributed towards the commission of the offence;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Plea of guilt</u>. Also as alluded to earlier in these grounds, I have some doubts as to whether the accused’s plea of guilty in this case demonstrated his genuine remorse. In any event, the sentencing bands under the <em>Low Song Chye</em> framework reflect the various sentencing bands where an offender has pleaded guilty<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. However, I had took this factor into account after determining the indicative sentence after the uplift on account of the enhanced punishment;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"/>(c)      <u>Other mitigating factors</u>. I have considered the various testimonials that have been annexed to the plea in mitigation, including the fact that the accused has since taken up boxing competitively and has done well enough to be selected into the Singapore National Team..</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"/>70     All considered, I was of the view that the indicative sentences should be adjusted downwards slightly. Accordingly, the final sentence I have reached are as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>DCN-900157-2022 (for the VCH offence against V1)</u>: three months’ imprisonment (from 15 weeks’ imprisonment); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>DCN-900156-2022 (for the VCH offence against V2)</u>: Two weeks’ imprisonment (from 15 days’ imprisonment).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Consecutive or concurrent sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"/>71     In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that the VCH offences committed by the Accused were unrelated. They reflected distinct acts of criminality committed by the Accused on separate victims. Each offence relied on a separate set of actions without overlap, and these actions cannot be said to necessarily or inevitably flow from each other.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"/>72     The Defence submitted that the offences formed a part of a single transaction, and hence, the two sentences of imprisonment should run concurrently (per <em>PP v Raveen Balakrishnan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22604-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 799</a> (“<em>Raveen</em>”), at [52] – [54])</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"/>73     In <em>Mohamed Shouffee</em> the High Court held sentences in respect of related offences (i.e. offences committed in the course of a single transaction) should be run concurrently (per <em>Mohamed Shouffee</em> at [27]-[31]). The High Court proceeded to explain that the rationale for the rule was the principle that sentences were not appropriate if the various offences involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. However, this was not a test to be rigidly applied.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"/>74     Having considered the facts in the present case. I accepted the Prosecutions submission that the two sentences of imprisonment that I had imposed should run consecutively. I was of the view that, although the offences were committed very close together in terms of time, they were distinct offences that were committed against different victims and did not form part of a single transaction. The fact that both offences were of the same type ie. VCH, did not mean that the two VCH offences committed part of a single transaction, as submitted by the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"/>75     Further, my decision t run the two sentences consecutively did not offend the totality principle. The total sentence was not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the more serious VCH offence committed and neither could it be termed as a crushing sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The final sentence imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"/>76     In summary I imposed the following sentences on the accused:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>DCN-900157-2022 (for the VCH offence against V1)</u>: three months’ imprisonment; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>DCN-900156-2022 (for the VCH offence against V2)</u>: Two weeks’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"/>77     I further ordered that the two sentences of imprisonment were to run consecutively, giving a total sentence of :</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="center"> <b><em>three months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment.</em></b> </div></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"/>78     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, now appeals against it.
