id="p1_1"/>1       These proceedings were brought by the State for the committal of Ms Fadaak Sahar Osama A (“Ms Fadaak”) for extradition. On 25 September 2022, Ms Fadaak was apprehended pursuant to a Warrant of Apprehension issued on 24 September 2022 by a Magistrate of the State Courts of Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. She was produced before a Magistrate on 26 September 2022. Subsequently, she was remanded pending the formal request for her extradition, and produced before a Magistrate within time intervals of not more than seven days each.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       On 22 November 2022, the United States of America (“United States”) submitted the formal extradition request which was received through the diplomatic channel. On 1 December 2022, the Minister for Law (“Minister”) rendered a Notice to the Magistrate pursuant to s 11(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Extradition Act 1968 (“Extradition Act”), that a request has been made to the Minister by the United States for the surrender of Ms Fadaak to face two counts of offences alleged to have been committed in the United States, namely, murder in the first degree and conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree against one Darwin Garcia Franco (“Deceased”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       On 21 December 2022, Ms Fadaak was produced before this court, and evidence was produced by the State in support of its request for the committal of Ms Fadaak pending the Minister’s order for the surrender Ms Fadaak to the United States. At these proceedings, Ms Fadaak elected not to testify or call any witnesses to give testimony.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable law</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       As Ms Fadaak did not consent to her surrender to the United States, the procedure under s 16(8) of the Extradition Act applied. If satisfied that the criteria under s 16(8) of the Extradition Act have been satisfied, the Magistrate is to issue a warrant for the commitment of Ms Fadaak to await the Minister’s order for surrender to the requesting state, the United States.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       Where the Magistrate receives a notice from the Minister under s 11(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Extradition Act that a request has been made for the surrender of a fugitive by a foreign state, the Magistrate was required to ascertain whether:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"/>(a)     There is a duly authenticated foreign warrant or overseas warrant in respect of the person issued in the foreign State that made the request for the surrender of the person, in accordance with s 16(8)(<em>a</em>) of the Extradition Act.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"/>(b)     In the case of a person who is accused of an extradition offence — there is a <em>prima facie</em> case that would justify the trial of the person if the act or omission constituting that offence had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of, Singapore in accordance with s 16(8)(b)(i) of the Extradition Act; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"/>(c)     After hearing any evidence tendered by the person, that the person is liable to be surrendered to the foreign State or declared Commonwealth territory that made the request for the surrender in accordance with s 16(8)(<em>c</em>) of the Extradition Act.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       Subsequent to Ms Fadaak’s apprehension, the Extradition Act was amended when s 9 of the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2022 took effect on 1 November 2022. The effect of the amendments relevant for present purposes was the deletion of the sub-provisions ss 16(1) to (7) of the Extradition Act, and the corresponding insertion of the substance of the deleted sub-provisions in ss 15A(1) to (7) of the Extradition Act. The intention behind these amendments was the segregation of the sub-provisions applicable to apprehended persons who consent to surrender in s 15A from the sub-provisions applicable to apprehended persons who do not consent to surrender in s 16, with consequential changes to the wording where necessary (see Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2022, Explanatory Statement).

Investigations revealed that Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi began a romantic relationship, and met from time to time at Ms Fadaak’s personal apartment at Belluvue.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"/>(b)     On 17 May 2019, the Deceased confronted Ms Fadaak (the Deceased’s wife), about his belief that she was unfaithful.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"/>(c)     On 22 May 2019, Ms Fadaak began looking for life insurance policies that would pay her the maximum amount available in the event of the Deceased’s death. Ms Fadaak was informed by an insurance salesperson that the policy premium could be reduced if the Deceased first obtained a medical physical. Ms Fadaak insisted that she needed insurance on the Deceased’s life immediately and was not interested in lowering policy premiums by having the Deceased attend a medical physical.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"/>(d)     On 28 May 2019, Ms Fadaak submitted for a policy with a $250,000 life benefit, listing her and her child as beneficiaries in the event of the Deceased’s death. Ms Fadaak went about making enquiries for a life insurance policy on the Deceased’s life even though Ms Fadaak told investigators that she was planning to leave the Deceased during an unrelated investigation with Child Protective Services. On 29 May 2019, Ms Fadaak was informed that the Deceased could not be insured as he did not have citizenship.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"/>(e)     At the time of the Deceased’s death, the Deceased lived with his wife Ms Fadaak and their young child in a split level two-floor home in Kirkland, Washington. The Deceased and family occupied the upper floor while one Nelida Zuniga (“Zuniga”) and three minor children rented and resided in the lower floor. That night, Ms Fadaak slept in a room across the hall, which was not a common occurrence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_f"/>(f)     The Deceased was killed on 31 May 2019 at about 2.00 am in his residence. There were no signs of forced entry, and Al Obaidi entered the residence and attacked the Deceased while the Deceased was asleep in bed, alone. Al Obaidi stabbed the Deceased a total of approximately 30 times, causing his death.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_g"/>(g)     The residents living downstairs were alerted by the sounds of the attack and came to investigate. Zuniga saw Al Obaidi attack the Deceased, and attempted to intervene. Al Obaidi stabbed Zuniga multiple times. The Deceased ran out of the room where he had initially been attacked, and Al Obaidi then turned to pursue the Deceased who eventually collapsed in a nearby hallway. Al Obaidi then turned to Zuniga and continued his attack on her, but the latter ultimately escaped and survived the attack, sustaining some 18 stab wounds.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_h"/>(h)     According to Zuniga, who was subsequently interviewed by investigators, Fadaak stood by, mere feet away, and quietly watched Al Obaidi attack the Deceased, making no effort to stop Al Obaidi’s attack on the Deceased. When Al Obaidi turned to attack Zuniga for the second time, Zuniga pleaded with Al Obaidi to stop. Ms Fadaak told Al Obaidi to stop, and Al Obaidi stopped his attack on Zuniga. Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi had a calm conversation with Al Obaidi in Arabic, a language Zuniga did not speak. Zuniga fled the residence. Al Obaidi did not attempt to harm Ms Fadaak, and Ms Fadaak did not yell, scream or try to deter or stop Al Obaidi’s attack on the Deceased.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_i"/>(i)     However, in a seemingly frantic phone call placed by Ms Fadaak to the police at about 2.10 am on the same day, Ms Fadaak claimed that somebody had come into her residence and an altercation had ensued. The dispatcher asked if Ms Fadaak recognised the person. Ms Fadaak claimed to only have seen her husband covered in blood and Zuniga, and did not mention Al Obaidi during her call to the police. Officers subsequently arrived on scene and found the Deceased. Investigators located a knife under the Deceased’s bed. Zuniga was conveyed to a hospital for surgery.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_j"/>(j)     In subsequent interviews with the Police, Ms Fadaak continued to omit mention that Al Obaidi was at the apartment at the time of the killing. She also showed investigators her mobile call records, which investigators later ascertained to contain only some call records, with certain records of calls with Al Obaidi on 30 May 2019 deleted.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_k"/>(k)     Given that the multiple call logs which were subsequently discovered were not present on Ms Fadaak’s phone when she showed her phone to investigators during an interview, investigators believe that she had deleted her call logs with Al Obaidi prior to the police interview. It was also subsequently established that several of the calls to the insurance companies placed by Ms Fadaak on 30 May 2019 were placed from Ms Fadaak’s apartment in Belluvue (different apartment from the one where the Deceased was killed), while Al Obaidi was in the Belluvue apartment with her, before they parted ways at about 12.00 noon. Al Obaidi remained in contact throughout the day with Ms Faak by phone between 12.36 pm and 11.18 pm on 30 May 2019. Investigators also subsequently discovered calls placed by Al Obaidi’s phone to Ms Fadaak at 2.14 and 2.29 am on 31 May 2019. The 2.14 am call was in fact placed while Ms Fadaak</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_l"/>(l)     On 31 May 2019, at about 8.00 am, Al Obaidi was arrested. Al Obaidi declined to speak with investigators. He was subsequently charged with murder of the Deceased in the First Degree and Attempted First Degree murder, and is being held in pre-trial confinement with no bail.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_m"/>(m)     On 9 April 2019, Ms Fadaak boarded a one-way flight to the United Arab Emirates with her child.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_n"/>(n)     Investigators believe that the evidence showed that the conspiracy and murder was motivated in whole or in part, by financial gain and a romantic relationship between Fadaak and Al Obaidi.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     On the basis of the facts in the Certification, the King County Superior Court issued a Warrant for the arrest of Ms Fadaak, with bail fixed at US$5m.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     Detective Haas’s affidavit also exhibited an autopsy report on the Deceased, and the opinion of the medical examiners is that the Deceased’s cause of death is multiple stab wounds (greater than 30), and that the manner of death is homicide. The same affidavit also exhibited cell phone records obtained by Detective Haas on the mobile records of Ms Fadaak, including deleted call logs, to and from Al Obaidi, as well as photographs recovered from Ms Fadaak’s mobile phone of her and Al Obaidi taken on 29 April 2019, Ms Fadaak’s birthday, when the Deceased was out of town. The photographs depicted them embracing and smiling, suggesting a close personal relationship. There were also records of calls placed with insurance companies in the days prior to the killing of the Deceased, including 30 May 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     Having heard the evidence presented and arguments made, the key issues arising for determination are essentially:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"/>(a)     Whether the two offences with which Ms Fadaak has been charged are “extradition offences”? Specifically in relation to Count 1, whether the abetment by instigation or aiding of an “extradition offence”, <em>viz</em>, murder, an offence for which extradition shall be reciprocally granted with the United States; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"/>(b)     Whether the State has adduced <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the commission by Ms Fadaak of the two offences, so as to justify extradition of Ms Fadaak to face trial in the United States on these two charges?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     These issues will be considered in the ensuing analysis which will examine whether all of the criteria for committal of a fugitive under s 16(8) of the Extradition Act have been satisfied.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a)   A duly authenticated warrant </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     A document purporting to be an overseas or foreign warrant is deemed duly authenticated and admissible in extradition proceedings under s 43(2)(<em>d</em>) of the Extradition Act, if it purports to be:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"/>(a)     Signed by a Judge, Magistrate or officer in or of the State or territory in which the document was issued; and if</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"/>(b)     The certification or signature of the Judge, Magistrate or officer purports to be authenticated by the oath, declaration or affirmation of a witness, or the document purports to be sealed with the official seal of a Minister in or of that State or territory.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     The warrant for Ms Fadaak’s arrest was exhibited as Exhibit B to SDA Washington’s affidavit in P5. It was issued by the Superior Court of Washington for King County as well as signed and sealed by the Deputy Clerk of the Superior Court, W Elizaldo Romero, for the Clerk of the Superior Court, Barbara Miner on 13 October 2020. The certified true copy of the said warrant was authenticated by oath by SDA Washington (at [9] of her affidavit) who obtained the certified true copy of the arrest warrant from the Clerk of Court. Thus, it is deemed duly authenticated for the purposes of these proceedings and admitted in evidence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   Ms Fadaak is a “fugitive”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     Counsel for Ms Fadaak submitted that Ms Fadaak is a Saudi Arabia national and was not a permanent resident of the United States. Therefore, she is not a fugitive in the “normal sense of the word”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> However, counsel also accepted that Ms Fadaak fell within the definition of “fugitive” for the purposes of s 2 of the Extradition Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> It is undisputed that Ms Fadaak is a person accused of an extradition offence alleged to have been committed within the jurisdiction of a foreign State (<em>ie</em>, the United States) and is presently in Singapore. The United States is a “foreign State” as there is an extradition treaty in force between the United States and Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">(c)   The two offences charged are “extradition offences”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     The definition of an “extradition crime” or what is now termed an “extradition offence” in the Extradition Act captures the principle of double criminality, <em>viz</em>, that the conduct charged as stated in the extradition request must be punishable in both the requesting State and in Singapore. The double criminality criterion does not require a search for exact correspondence between the elements of offences in the requesting State and in Singapore (see <em>Wong Yuh Lan v PP and or matters</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0845.xml')">[2012] 4 SLR 845</a> (“<em>Wong Yuh Lan</em>”) at [13] – [14]). The amendments to the Extradition Act in 2022 (see Acts 17 of 2022 and 31 of 2022) did not alter the position established in <em>Wong Yuh Lan.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Count 2</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     According to affidavit of Senior Prosecution Attorney LaKeysha N Washington which was admitted in evidence without objection from counsel for Ms Fadaak, the offence of Conspiracy to Commit Murder in the First Degree in the United States is constituted by evidence of the following elements:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"/>(a)     On or about 1 April 2019 to 31 May 2019, Ms Fadaak agreed with Al Obaidi to engage in or cause the performance of murder in the first degree (<em>ie</em>, premeditated murder).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"/>(b)     Ms Fadaak made the agreement with the intent that such conduct be performed. Such agreement may be inferred from the life insurance policy requests shortly before the murder, the increased communication between Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi shortly before the murder and an attempt by Ms Fadaak to conceal the communication between her and Al Obaidi from law enforcement.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"/>(c)     Al Obaidi, who was involved in the agreement, took a substantial step in pursuance of the agreement, by stabbing the Deceased multiple times.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"/>(d)     The killing of the Deceased took place in Washington.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     It is not disputed that Count 2 is an “extradition offence” for the purposes of s 2 of the Extradition Act. This is because the act or omission constituting the offence would, if it had taken place within Singapore, constitute an offence of criminal conspiracy to commit murder under s 300(a) read with s 120B of the Penal Code. The offence carries a maximum punishment of not less than two years and is not an excluded offence under the First Schedule to the Extradition Act. The offence which is the subject of Count 2 is an offence for which extradition shall be reciprocally granted pursuant to Art 3 of the United States of America (Extradition) Order in Council, 1935 (Cap 103, OR 1) (“United States Order in Council”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     It was held in <em>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0619.xml')">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619</a> (at [75] – [76]) and affirmed more recently in <em>Er Joo Nguang and anor v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 1 SLR(R) 0756.xml')">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 756</a>, that unlike criminal conspiracy as defined in s 120A of the Penal Code, abetment by conspiracy for the purposes of s 107(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Penal Code requires some further act to be done pursuant to the conspiracy, as opposed to a mere agreement to do or cause to be done an illegal act. The offence of a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence as defined in s 120A(1) of the Penal Code does not require an act to take place in pursuance to the conspiracy, and would be constituted in Singapore if the conduct that is charged under Count 2 took place within the jurisdiction of Singapore. Accordingly, the conduct charged in Count 2 satisfies the definition of an “extradition offence” for the purposes of s 2 of the Extradition Act.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Count 1</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     In relation to Count 1, it was contended on behalf of Ms Fadaak, that the offence charged did not constitute an offence in Singapore and therefore failed to satisfy the “double criminality” requirement. The argument, as I understand it, is that Ms Fadaak cannot be charged for murder under Singapore law even if the alleged acts causing death (<em>ie</em>, the stabbing of the Deceased) took place in Singapore, as these acts were performed by Al Obaidi and not Ms Fadaak.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It was contended for Ms Fadaak that <em>actus reus</em> is an essential element of the offence of murder in Singapore, unlike in the United States, where accomplices can be held liable as if they were the principal offender for engaging in or causing the commission of an offence by the principal offender.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     The State submits that the alleged conduct providing the basis for Count 1 corresponds to the offence of abetment of murder by aiding or instigation under s 300(a) read with s 109, punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code. I agree with the State’s submission, that in applying the “conduct” test as set out in <em>Wong Yuh Lan</em>, it is critical to ascertain whether the alleged conduct in the foreign State constituted an offence in Singapore. Despite purporting to apply the “conduct test”, the submission of counsel for the fugitive seemed, in actual fact, to apply the “ingredients test”, as the submission focussed rather narrowly on the correspondence of the elements constituting the offence of murder in the United States and in Singapore, rather than on whether the conduct charged would have been an offence if it had been committed in Singapore, for which extradition shall be granted. The High Court held in <em>Wong Yuh Lan</em> at [36], adopting the test laid out by the House of Lords in <em>re Nielson</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68015-E-M.xml')">[1984] 1 AC 606</a>, that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it was not necessary to refer to the elements of the foreign offence. The committing magistrate only had the jurisdiction under the Extradition Act… to decide whether there was such evidence that would, according to the law of the Requested State (and not the Requesting State), justify committal of the fugitive for an offence that fell under one the categories of extraditable offences… The test… is not “whether the offence specified in the foreign warrant of arrest… was substantially similar to a crime under [the Requested State’s] law falling within the list of offences described in … the Extradition Act… but “whether the <em>conduct</em> of the accused, if it had been committed in [the Requested State] would have constituted a crime falling within one or more of the descriptions included in that list.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     SDA Washington stated in her affidavit, that based on her experience and understanding of the laws in Washington, United States, Count 1, an offence of murder in the first degree, would be made out if:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"/>(a)     Ms Fadaak or an accomplice (Al Obaidi) acted with intent to cause the death of the Deceased,</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"/>(b)     The causing of death was premeditated,</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"/>(c)     Death was caused as a result of the act,</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"/>(d)     The acts occurred in the state of Washington.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     According to the said affidavit at [15]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The law recognises that ordinarily, anything a person can do for herself may also be accomplished through direction of another person as an agent, or by acting together with or under the direction of another person as an agent, or by acting together with, or under the direction of, another person or persons in a joint effort. <em>So, if the acts or conduct of an agent, employee or other associate of the defendant were wilfully directed or authorised by the defendant, or if the defendant engaged in or caused the performance of another person by wilfully joining together with that person in the commission of a crime, then the law holds the defendant responsible for the conduct of that person just as though the defendant had engaged in such conduct herself…</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     It is not the State’s case that based on the information affirmed and certified by the relevant officers of the United States, that Ms Fadaak committed any physical act that caused the death of the Deceased. Rather, the State submits that it has presented a <em>prima facie</em> case of abetment by instigation or aiding under s 300(a) read with s 109, punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code, in addition to a criminal conspiracy to commit murder under s 120B read with s 300(a) of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     The United States intends<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> to adduce evidence at trial of premeditated murder, and intends to prove that Ms Fadaak acted together with Al Obaidi relying on evidence of a romantic relationship between Ms Fadaak and Mr Al Obaidi, her pursuit of the maximum insurance policy on the Deceased’s life in the days prior to murder and in particular, discussing the insurance policies with the insurance company in the presence of Al Obaidi one day before the Deceased was killed, despite expressing the intention to leave the Deceased. SDA Washington’s affidavit also alluded to an intention to rely on evidence of the frequency and timing of Ms Fadaak’s communications with Mr Al Obaidi in the period leading up to the death of the Deceased, especially in the hours just before the murder. The United States also intends to rely on evidence that the Deceased’s residence was left unlocked prior to the murder, of Ms Fadaak’s uunsual decision to sleep in her child’s room instead of the bedroom she shared with the Deceased at the material time, as well as evidence that Ms Fadaak had stood by as the Deceased was attacked multiple times by Al Obaidi with a knife; and Ms Fadaak’s subsequent conduct in concealing from investigators her knowledge that Al Obaidi was the assailant.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     Essentially, the United States asserts that Ms Fadaak participated by assisting Al Obaidi in the commission of the offence of murder in the first degree, and was a part of the premeditation of the offence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The United States also intends to prove Ms Fadaak’s participation in instigating the attack, given that Zuniga’s account suggests that Ms Fadaak was in a position to instruct Al Obaidi, who obeyed Ms Fadaak’s instruction to desist during the second attack on Zuniga, which the United States views as evidence that Ms Fadaak directed the attack.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     The conduct charged, constituting the elements stated above at [22] therefore correspond to an offence of abetment by aiding, and an offence of abetment by instigation to cause death, if committed in Singapore. It should also be noted that it is specifically provided for in Art 3 of the United States Order in Council, that extradition shall be reciprocally granted for the following crimes or offences:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Murder (including assassination, parricide, infanticide, poisoning), or attempt or conspiracy to murder.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…..</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>Extradition is also to be granted for participation in any of the aforesaid crimes or offences, provided that such participation be punishable by the laws of both High Contracting Parties.</em> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     If the argument made by counsel for Ms Fadaak were to be accepted, <em>viz</em>, that extradition was to be granted reciprocally <em>only</em> for the offences listed, <em>ie</em>, “murder… or attempt or conspiracy to murder”, there would be no purpose for the words in emphasis. Extradition should be granted reciprocally in respect of participation in listed offences so long as the necessary conditions were satisfied, <em>viz</em>, that the participation in the offence was punishable by the laws of both the United States and Singapore. It is within this statutory framework, that the pronouncements in <em>Wong Yuh Lan</em> concerning the interpretation of Art 3 of the United States Order in Council are to be understood, <em>viz</em>,</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"/>(a)     that the court should focus on the conduct stated in the extradition request, to ascertain whether the offence concerned is sufficiently serious to warrant extradition, bearing in mind that offending conduct can be described in broad generic terms, popular language or in varying degrees of specificity or detail (see <em>Wong Yuh Lan</em> at [35]); and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"/>(b)     Art 3 of the United States Order in Council has a “participation” limb that was wide enough to cover all punishable forms of abetment in Singapore, including abetment by conspiracy, aiding or instigation (see <em>Wong Yuh Lan</em> at [37]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">(d)   Prima facie evidence justifying trial on the two counts charged adduced</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     Counsel for Ms Fadaak contended that the calls made to the insurance companies on the eve of the Deceased’s death do not go towards showing that there was a conspiracy to commit murder. Counsel for Ms Fadaak suggested to DSP Shen that as Ms Fadaak had in the course of her work in the insurance business discovered that the Deceased’s insurance policies had lapsed, she therefore made urgent calls to obtain fresh insurance for him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     It was also contended that because Al Obaidi was charged for inflicting the wounds that caused the Deceased’s death, (charges admitted as D4), and because the charges against Al Obaidi contained no references to Ms Fadaak, that there was no basis for the charge of conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Connected to this is a related argument that since there was no DNA analysis report adduced to link Ms Fadaak in any way to the knife suspected to have been used in the commission of the murder, there is no evidence that Ms Fadaak committed murder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Counsel also asserts that there is no direct evidence, such as text messages recovered by the United States investigators evidencing any explicit planning to commit murder on the Deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     The applicable standard is that of a <em>prima facie</em> case to be answered by Ms Fadaak. The explanation offered for the inquires with insurance companies was a matter for the trial court. It was not clear whether D4, which appeared to be records obtained in respect of the charges against Al Obaidi contained the latest version of the charges against him, and in any event, no evidence has been tendered concerning any findings made by any court of the requesting State concerning Al Obaidi’s commission of any offence(s), and whether or how Ms Fadaak had participated in such offending. Thus, the fact that D4 showed that the charges against Al Obaidi made no mention of Ms Fadaak’s presence at the scene of the offences do not detract from the State’s case for Ms Fadaak’s extradition.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     Based on the information provided in the United States’ request for extradition, there was evidence uncovered during investigations that satisfied the burden of adducing <em>prima facie</em> evidence of a conspiracy with Al Obaidi to commit murder of the Deceased. This is shown mainly by:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"/>(a)     the phone logs and photographs showing that there was possibly an increasingly close romantic relationship between Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi in the months preceding the Deceased’s killing;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"/>(b)     The Deceased had accused Ms Fadaak of infidelity in the month of his demise, which is evidenced by text messages between the Deceased and Ms Fadaak on 18 May 2019. Ms Fadaak had in fact informed investigators in a separate investigation (Child Protective Services) mere days before the Deceased’s killing that she intended to leave the Deceased;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"/>(c)     Investigators learned from insurance companies, that in the period shortly preceding the Deceased’s death, Ms Fadaak began making urgent inquiries with insurance companies to obtain insurance on the Deceased’s life. Despite being informed that insurance premiums could be lowered if the Deceased underwent a medical examination, Ms Fadaak persisted with obtaining the maximum coverage without a medical examination. Despite Ms Fadaak’s efforts, insurance coverage could not be obtained as the Deceased was not a citizen of the United States;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"/>(d)     Ms Fadaak’s phone records showing contact with Al Obaidi throughout the day of the murder were deleted before Ms Fadaak showed her mobile phone to investigators in a police interview. Phone records also showed communications with various insurance companies to which she had made inquiries to obtain an insurance policy on the Deceased’s life. There was also CCTV footage that placed Al Obaidi together with Ms Fadaak in her Belluvue apartment while she placed calls to insurance companies on 30 May 2019.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_e"/>(e)     Zuniga, who survived the attack by Al Obaidi on 31 May 2019, had given statements placing Ms Fadaak at the scene of the killing, watching quietly as Al Obaidi’s attack on the Deceased took place, and conversing calmly with Al Obaidi after Zuniga was attacked by Al Obaidi. Zuniga’s statements contradicted Ms Fadaak’s statements that she did not see the Deceased’s assailant, and Ms Fadaak’s subsequent expressions of disbelief that Al Obaidi had been identified as the assailant, which could support the inference that Ms Fadaak had not been truthful with investigators to conceal her involvement in the offences charged.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     In my view, there was <em>prima facie</em> evidence, which was not inherently incredible, of the existence of a criminal conspiracy to murder (the charge in Count 2). There was some evidence of a romantic relationship between Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi and financial motive, as can be seen from the multiple calls with insurance companies on the Deceased’s life despite Ms Fadaak’s stated intention to leave the Deceased. The evidence that Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi had met in Ms Fadaak’s apartment on 30 May 2019 where Ms Fadaak placed calls to insurance companies, and continued frequent communications on the day preceding the murder which Ms Fadaak sought to conceal from investigators, went towards the possible inference of a conspiracy. That there was a conspiracy to murder can also be seen from the evidence that Ms Fadaak had removed herself from the Deceased’s bedroom, which was unusual behaviour on her part. Furthermore, Zuniga’s statements revealed that Ms Fadaak had watched the killing of the Deceased by Al Obaidi, and had calm conversation with Al Obaidi who did not try to hurt her. The threads of evidence taken together, was sufficient to form a <em>prima facie</em> case that Ms Fadaak and Al Obaidi had an agreement to commit the murder of the Deceased. Accordingly, I find that the State has adduced <em>prima facie</em> evidence that Ms Fadaak had committed the conduct charged in respect of Count 2.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     The State submitted that the same set of facts also form the basis for a finding that <em>prima facie</em> evidence has been adduced that Count 1 has been committed of “aiding and / instigating” the murder of the Deceased which was not inherently incredible. I queried whether it was State Counsel’s position that the same set of facts go to show both forms abetment <em>viz</em>, both aiding and instigation of murder, and if so, what was the evidence which made out each form of abetment. I queried specifically, the accuracy of State Counsel’s written submissions at [37(c)] which was repeated again in State Counsel’s reply submissions at [9(b)(i)], that investigations by the United States revealed that Ms Fadaak had assisted Al Obaidi’s commission of murder by providing the numeric code to access the Deceased apartment <em>and</em> leaving the door unlocked at the material time of the murder as the latter seemed unnecessary if the former was done.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     In answer to the queries posed, the State essentially asserts that the same set of facts, if assumed true, would also disclose two offences if committed in Singapore, <em>viz</em>, abetment by aiding <em>and</em> abetment by instigation of Al Obaidi’s murder of the Deceased. With respect to abetment of murder by aiding, I was not satisfied that there was any evidence tendered which went to show that it was Ms Fadaak who had left the door to the Deceased’s apartment unlocked at the material time in light of the number of residents in the apartment. This is because Detective Haas’ affidavit did not set out any statement or account that the Deceased’s apartment was left unlocked by Ms Fadaak just prior to the killing. Contrary to the State’s submission, the numeric code provided by Ms Fadaak to Al Obaidi was for her apartment in Belluvue, not for the Deceased’s apartment. SDA Washington’s affidavit, which asserts that there is evidence that Ms Fadaak had assisted by unlocking the upstairs portion of the Deceased’s apartment where only the Deceased, Ms Fadaak and her son resided, does not point to any evidence showing this fact.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     That said, I was of the view that there was sufficient evidence from which an inference could be made, and a case for Ms Fadaak to answer in respect of abetment by instigation of the murder of the Deceased. Ms Fadaak’s quiet presence during the killing of the Deceased by Al Obaidi as observed by Zuniga, as well as Ms Fadaak’s role in pursuing life insurance on the Deceased’s life shortly prior to the murder, and Al Obaidi’s demonstrated obedience of Ms Fadaak’s instruction to desist from his attack on Zuniga, altogether, could support an inference that Al Obaidi had attacked the Deceased on her instruction. Even if I was wrong, it seems to me that Al Obaidi’s attack on the Deceased was pursuant to a conspiracy between Al Obaidi and Ms Fadaak to commit murder on the Deceased. Accordingly, the conduct which forms the basis for Count 1, if transposed to Singapore, would constitute an offence of abetment of murder, under s 300(a) punishable under s 302 and read with s 109 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     For completeness, I will address the submission made for the fugitive that the inferences which the United States will seek to be made by the trial court are not sustainable (that Ms Fadaak instigated and aided the Deceased murder out of financial motivation and desire to maintain a romantic relationship with Al Obaidi) and that the veracity of Zuniga’s account that Ms Fadaak had stood by while Al Obaidi attacked the Deceased is in question<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. These are issues for the trial court concerning whether Ms Fadaak is guilty of the offences charged, and this is not the forum for such issues to be decided.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     As the State has satisfied all the necessary criteria stated in s 16(8) of the Extradition Act, I order Ms Fadaak’s committal by a warrant to await the Minister’s warrant for her surrender to the United States.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     In accordance with s 19(1) of the Extradition Act, I now inform Ms Fadaak that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"/>(a)     You may apply for a review of the order under s 17 or waive your right to do so, and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"/>(b)     You will not be surrendered until the expiry of the period of 15 days after the date of your committal unless you decide to waive your right to apply for a review of this order under s 17 of the Extradition Act.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Exhibit P3 and P4;
