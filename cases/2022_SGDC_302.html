The location of the offence was given as 820 Thomson Road, Mount Alvernia Hospital, Singapore 574623 (“the Incident Location”).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The offence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       On 10 December 2020, the accused sought admission to the Hospital for a day surgery to be conducted by Dr Ho Kok Yuen. During the admission, the accused informed one of the Hospital’s administrations staff that he would be providing a Letter of Guarantee (“LOG”) from his insurance company, AXA Insurance Pte Ltd (“AXA”). The accused also provided his credit card details to Mount Alvernia’s staff.

In this connection, the accused intended that the document forged shall be used to induce the Hospital into processing the surgery, which the hospital would not have done if it had not been so deceived.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       The accused provided a copy of the forged AXA LOG to the Hospital’s staff. Subsequently, the Hospital submitted the medical bills (which amounted to S$20,892.72) together with the forged AXA LOG to AXA. However, the Hospital was informed by AXA that the LOG was forged and not issued by AXA. The Hospital then tried debiting the accused’s credit card, but the transaction was declined. They also tried emailing the accused to request for payment, but he did not respond. As such, a police report was lodged.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       The accused was placed under arrest and during investigations, the accused admitted to forging the AXA LOG so that he could proceed with the surgery.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     Investigations also revealed that (a) the accused could continue with his daily activities with some degree of low back pain even if the surgery had not been performed (as long as it was well controlled with medications or by other means) and (b) the surgical procedure could have been done at any hospital that had pain management specialists who could perform the surgery.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     To date, the accused has not made any restitution.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts pertaining to the 4<sup>th</sup> charge of Cheating (DAC 911295-2022)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     The victim and complainant is Wong Kar Wah, Colin.

He then contacted the accused via the mobile phone number [redacted], expressing his interest.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     The accused then informed the victim that he could sell a 3-day 2-night MBS Hotel Staycation, from 20 August 2021 to 22 August 2021, for S$350. The victim agreed, believing that the accused could sell him a MBS Hotel Staycation. Pursuant to their agreement, the victim transferred S$200 as a deposit via PayNow to handphone number [redacted], which was linked to a DBS A/C: [redacted], both of which belonged to the accused. The accused then informed the victim that the booking confirmation number was 3645170. Unbeknownst to the victim, the accused did not in fact have a MBS Hotel Staycation to sell.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     On 17 August 2021, the victim contacted the accused to seek assurance that there were no issues with the MBS Hotel Staycation booking. The accused did not respond to him. The victim, after checking with MBS, realised that the booking confirmation number (previously provided by the accused) was invalid. Realizing that he had been cheated, the victim lodged a police report to seek assistance.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     The accused had deceived the victim into believing that he had a MBS Hotel Staycation to sell, a fact which he knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, dishonestly induced the victim into transferring S$200 to him.

The victim then asked the accused to refund the monies paid (<em>i.e.</em>, S$700). The accused claimed that he would do so by the next day. However, the accused did not refund the monies.

The Prosecution submitted that the forged Letter of Guarantee by AXA was an important document, and a deterrent sentence was warranted. No restitution had been made.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     The Prosecution relied on the following case precedents:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"/>(a)     In <em>Lim Ek Kian v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/212-M.xml')">[2003] SGHC 58</a> at [35] (“<em>Lim Ek Kian</em>”), Yong Pung How CJ (“Yong CJ”) commented that the “courts have always treated offences under s 468 PC seriously, and past cases <em>have adopted a 12-month sentence of imprisonment as a benchmark</em>”. In <em>Lim Ek Kian</em>, the offender, who had claimed trial, was the managing director of company which, at the time, was the Singapore distributor for Skoda cars. Pursuant to the offender’s fraudulent behaviour, a sum of S$9,237 was involved. The offender’s sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was upheld on appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"/>(b)     In <em>PP v Tang Wai Kit</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25054-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 222</a> (“<em>Tang Wai Kit</em>”), the offender pleaded guilty to two charges under s 420 Penal Code and four charges under s 468 Penal Code. In respect of the s 468 Penal Code charges, the offender forged purchase orders to deceive the company into believing that DuPont (the company’s customer) had made an order to the company which had been fulfilled through procurement of products from Gim Guan (the company’s supplier). This induced the victim (the company’s sales coordinator) into making payments to Gim Guan (the company’s supplier), whereby Gim Guan would obtain 20% of the payments, and the offender would obtain the remaining 80%. No restitution was made. In respect of the proceeded s 468 Penal Code charge concerning the sum of S$26,910, 15 months’ imprisonment was imposed by the court. The global sentence meted out on the offender was 84 months’ imprisonment. The offender withdrew his appeal against sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     The Prosecution submitted that its sentencing position had already taken into consideration the accused’s show of contrition, as evinced by his decision to plead guilty, as a mitigating factor. The Prosecution submitted that no mitigating weight ought to be accorded to the fact that the accused had committed the offence to procure medical treatment as the treatment obtained was an elective surgery, and there was no reason why the accused had to obtain the same at a private hospital as opposed to a public hospital.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     For the cheating charges, the Prosecution submitted that the accused was of relatively low culpability and that the harm involved was slight. However, bearing in mind that the accused had committed both s 420 Penal Code offences while he was on bail, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of one to two months’ imprisonment should be imposed for each charge.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s mitigation and submission on sentence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     The Defence submitted for a global sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment. This comprised a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the forgery charge and a sentence of one months’ imprisonment for each of the cheating charges with the imprisonment term for the forgery charge to run consecutively with the imprisonment term for one of the cheating charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     The Defence highlighted that the accused was involved in an accident in 2006 which resulted in two fractured vertebrae and extensive spinal fusion. He underwent a major surgery following the said accident when his spine was fused together in 2008. Since then, his spine was in a state of decay, and he had been suffering chronic back pain linked with several degenerative conditions with which he has been diagnosed. As a result of these conditions, the accused had been on long-term medical treatment which includes a legitimate prescription for oxycodone to help relieve his pain.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the accused would travel to the United States on a regular basis to receive medical treatment and a longer-term oxycodone prescription from his usual doctors. However, the ensuing travel restrictions occasioned by Covid-19 had prevented him from doing so. As such, his pain had gradually worsened since the start of the pandemic in 2020, and the accused had no choice but to obtain prescriptions for much shorter durations and at much higher cost in Singapore. The accused was only able to obtain prescriptions for two to four weeks at a time and he was required to return to the doctor frequently to obtain new prescriptions. Each of these visits cost the accused an average of $400 to $500 for consultations and medications every two to four weeks.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     To further exacerbate his situation, the accused had recently started a new job. As he had no medical leave entitlement, he was not able to take time off from work to see the doctors. He had been juggling between finding time to consult a doctor on a regular basis and meeting his work obligations. On top of that, he was financially burdened by the frequent consultations and medications. He could not afford the cost of the surgery and thus forged the guarantee letter so that he could proceed with his surgery.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     The accused’s father passed away in May 2020, which was during the initial phase of the pandemic when its global threat was at its highest and travel restrictions were at its tightest. His youngest brother was married in September 2020 which he was not able to attend in the United States nor was he able to visit his two nephews when they were born subsequently. The lack of familial support from his kins whom he has a close-knit familial relationship did not help in the stress and difficulties he was experiencing here in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     The Defence submitted that the accused did not commit the alleged offences with malice aforethought but because of a misguided attempt to alleviate his unbearable pain. He had committed the alleged offence out of genuine frustration and desperation that had been building up over the course of a year. He had turned to these missteps for a short-term solution to alleviate his pain and the primary motivation was not to cause harm to society. The accused regretted this serious lapse in his judgement and was profusely sorry for the alleged incident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     The Defence submitted that the accused’s motivation for committing the offence should be considered as a mitigating factor, or at the very least, a neutral factor for sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     With regard to the Prosecution’s assertion that the said surgery was elective and obtainable instead at a public hospital, the Defence submitted that the accused was in genuine debilitative pain, and had difficulty obtaining his pain medication for the year prior to the offence. He thus had no way to effectively manage his pain; his desperation and the physical pain clouded his mind and led to him committing the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     The Defence submitted while it did not seek to condone such unlawful actions as a means for impecunious individuals suffering from debilitating ailments to receive medical treatment, it nonetheless submitted that such actions by the accused could be sympathised with, in the same way as it has been said that ‘People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving’.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     The Defence submitted that the forgery charge in the present case was quite different from the usual cheating offences that featured in the news or in case law, including those cited by the Prosecution such as <em>Tang Wai Kit w</em>here the offender got a 80% cut of the cheated amount. The Defence submitted that most, if not all of the cases available on this offence featured a fact scenario where the offender cheated for personal monetary gains. This was not the case with regard to the accused who had committed the offence to cure or alleviate a long-standing condition of ill-health which he has woefully been suffering from for more than a decade.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     The Defence submitted that it would therefore not be helpful to apply the observations of Yong CJ in <em>Lim Ek Kian</em> using a 12-month sentence of imprisonment as a benchmark based on past cases in a manner that was too broadbrush since Yong CJ’s dictum concerned a factual matrix of cheating for personal financial gains where the element of personal greed was very much at play.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     The Defence submitted that the fact that the offender did not make any financial gain or benefit from his crime was a “legitimate mitigating factor” and this was recognised in <em>Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor</em> [1993] 3 SLR 305 at [3] (“<em>Lai Oei Mui Jenny”</em>). This principle was aptly summarized in DN Kirk &amp; AJJ Woodcock, <em>Serious Fraud: Investigation and Trial</em> (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 1997) at page 207:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Within the parameters of fraud, the degrees of moral culpability are many. There must, in fairness, be a distinction drawn between those who set out to defraud the weak and vulnerable and who obtain for themselves lavish lifestyles as a result, and those who have, albeit improperly, yielded to business pressures and have derived no benefit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     The Defence maintained that the scenario in the present case was not of cheating for financial gain as in the cases cited by the Prosecution. Rather, the accused had committed the forgery offence to escape the debilitating pain the accused was experiencing. The Defence submitted that it was open to the court to rule on whether offending to seek medical treatment in a case such as the present one deserved to be treated as a mitigating factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     In seeking a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the s 468 Penal Code charge, the Defence relied on two cases. The first was the case of <em>PP v Seet Choo Mong</em> [2009[ SGDC 364 (“<em>Seet Choo Mong</em>”) with an extract taken from <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“Sentencing Practice”) at pages 1012–1013. The extract stated that the offender was given temporary shelter at his sister’s home. He saw his brother-in-law’s cheque book and dishonestly took one cheque. He forged the latter’s signature and made it out as a cash cheque for $30,500. He presented this at the bank and successfully withdrew the sum. The offender also dishonestly took his sister’s credit card and PIN. With these, he made five unauthorised withdrawals totalling $5,000. He used the money to pay his debts and for his personal expenses. He pleaded guilty to a forgery charge under s 468 and two theft charges under s 379. Three similar theft charges were taken into consideration. He made partial restitution of $10,500 out of the total sum of $35,500. He was traced with two previous convictions for criminal breach of trust. The court imposed four months’ imprisonment for the forgery charge, and one month’s imprisonment for each of the theft charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     The next case was <em>Ang Hui Hoon Candace Reis v PP</em> [2009[ SGHC 226 (“<em>Candace Ang</em>”) with an extract taken from Sentencing Practice at pages 1012–1013. The offender had forged her husband’s signature on various bank and insurance documents to make unauthorised withdrawals and surrender requests respectively. The misappropriated moneys amounted to $152,453.22 and were used by the offender to settle personal debts and other expenses. The offender was a first-time offender who had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 468 Penal Code, with four similar charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender did not make any restitution, but instead agreed with her husband and mother-in-law to forgo her right to claim maintenance for their one-year-old child. On appeal, the court reduced the offender’s sentence from 12 months’ imprisonment per charge to two months’ imprisonment per charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     The Defence submitted that the present offence was less aggravated than <em>Tang Wai Kit</em> but more aggravating than <em>Seet Choo Mong</em> and <em>Candace Ang</em> as there was no abuse of trust and no monetary benefit gained. The accused was a first offender who had pleading guilty and had fully cooperated with the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     As for the cheating charges, the Defence submitted for a sentence of one months’ imprisonment for each charge. The accused was on a special pass during the period of his investigation, and having lost his employment, he had to rely on his already depleted savings. This added to his difficulties and was a reason for his resorting to the cheating offences to obtain some monies to weather the tide.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The forgery charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     An offence of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 Penal Code carries a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 10 years and/or fine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     The Defence sought a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment for the forgery charge whereas the Prosecution sought a sentence of 12 to 14 months’ imprisonment. The Defence’s main plank of argument was that the accused was not motivated by greed and financial gain unlike those offenders in the cases cited by the Prosecution. The Prosecution countered that pursuant to the accused’s forgery, he had received a surgical procedure from the Hospital and the medical bills amounted to $20,892.72 and no restitution had been made.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     While there is currently no sentencing framework for an offence under s 468 Penal Code, in <em>Lim Ek Kian</em> Yong CJ held at [35]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The courts have always treated offences under s 468 PC seriously, and past cases have adopted a 12-month sentence of imprisonment as a benchmark.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     In <em>Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20745-SSP.xml')">[2017] 2 SLR 449</a> the Court of Appeal held at [32]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the benchmark approach is particularly suited for offences which overwhelmingly manifest in a particular way or where a particular variant or manner of offending is extremely common and is therefore singled out for special attention</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     In <em>Abu Syeed Chowdhury v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0182.xml')">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 182</a> (“<em>Abu Syeed Chowdhury”</em>) Yong CJ explained the purpose of a “benchmark” in the following way (at [15]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>A ‘benchmark’ is a sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every judge, ensuring consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. It is not cast in stone, nor does it represent an abdication of the judicial prerogative to tailor criminal sanctions to the individual offender. It instead provides the focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can be accurately determined</b>. A good ‘benchmark’ decision therefore lays down carefully the parameters of its reasoning in order to allow future judges to determine what falls within the scope of the ‘norm’, and what exceptional situations justify departure from it.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"/>53     I respectfully disagreed with the Defence’s submission that Yong CJ’s observation of a benchmark sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment in <em>Lim Ek Kian</em> was specifically about a factual matrix of cheating for personal financial gains where the element of personal greed was very much at play. This was in fact <em>not</em> the factual matrix of <em>Lim Ek Kian</em> as an argument was made by the offender there that he had <em>not</em> benefited financially from the offence. Yong CJ appeared to have implicitly accepted this where he held at [36] that while the offender may not have derived a direct benefit, his actions enabled him to continue his business and fulfil his company’s obligations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"/>54     That said, it was, in my respectful view, not precisely articulated from Yong CJ’s Grounds of Decision in <em>Lim Ek Kian</em> as what variant of offences under s 468 Penal Code he was referring which manifested in a particular way for such a benchmark to be adopted.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"/>55     In the circumstances, while a benchmark sentence may be the starting point for an offence under s 468 Penal Code, it may not be the end point and even if a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was the starting point, the differing levels of harm and culpability of a particular case may justify a departure from this starting point.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"/>56     The Defence relied on the cases of <em>Candace Ang</em> and <em>Seet Choo Mong</em>. I first considered <em>Candice Ang</em> where Choo Han Teck J held at [4] as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The appellant had pleaded guilty and confessed her intention to deceive the banks. When confronted by the complainant prior to his making a police report, she had confessed and offered to compensate him although she was unable to do so immediately. The appellant eventually entered into an agreement with both the complainant and the complainant’s mother in which she agreed to forgo her right to claim maintenance for their one-year old child if she was not required to make restitution. The learned DJ was of the view that the complainant’s mother w s the real victim in this case as the monies represented her life savings and the agreement reached would be of poor comfort to her. While that may be true, the settlement agreement that the mother consented to was not utterly without comfort to her. <b>It would not be productive to speculate the precise nature of this comfort save to note that, the mother’s loss was not, in itself, sufficient to impose a custodial sentence of 12 months on the facts of this unusual case. For that reason, the sentence here would not be a general precedent.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"/>57     As specifically emphasised by Choo J, on the unusual facts of the case, <em>Candace Ang was not</em> to be a general precedent<em>.</em> I therefore find <em>Candace Ang</em> to be of little assistance to the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"/>58     Next, I turned to <em>Seet Choo Mong</em>. He was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment term for the offence under Section 468 of the Penal Code and one month’s imprisonment term for each of the charges under Section 379 Penal Code with the imprisonment terms for the charge under Section 468 (DAC 8725 of 2009) and one charge under Section 379 (DAC 8726 of 2009) ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was five months’ imprisonment. He had made restitution of $10,500 out of the total sum of $35,500.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"/>59     I note that in arriving at his sentence, the District Judge in <em>Seet Choo Mong</em> made no reference in his Grounds of Decision to Yong CJ’s benchmark sentence in <em>Lim Ek Kian</em>, even though the latter was decided some six years before <em>Seet Choo Mong</em>. Further, as <em>Lim Ek Kian</em> was a decision of the High Court (as opposed to <em>Seet Choo Mong</em>), it was binding on me. In any event, <em>Seet Choo Moong</em> differed from the present case in that there was partial restitution unlike the present case where no restitution had been made and the Defence was prepared to concede that the facts of the current case were more aggravated than that in <em>Seet Choo Mong.</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"/>60     In calibrating the appropriate sentence in the present case, I found it useful to consider the offence specific factors in terms of harm and culpability. The Defence submitted that the accused did not commit the offence out of greed or for financial benefit but to escape the debilitating pain he was experiencing. To my mind, the motivation for the commission of the offence goes towards considering the culpability of the accused and this was in line with the Defence’s cited passage from DN Kirk &amp; AJJ Woodcock which stated that “<em>Within the parameters of fraud, the degrees of moral culpability are many</em>.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"/>61     In this regard, I accepted that the accused was less culpable than the offender in <em>Tang Wai Kit</em> who had financially benefited from the forgery by receiving a commission of 80% and was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. That said, the present case can be distinguished from what was stated by DN Kirk &amp; AJJ Woodcock of a situation where offenders who had “improperly yielded to business pressures and have <em>derived no benefit</em>”. To my mind, it was clear that the accused in the present case <em>did</em> personally receive a benefit of a surgery from the Hospital for his medical condition without paying a cent of the medical bills amounting to $20,892.72.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"/>62     Next, there was pre-meditation on the accused’s part. During his admission the accused informed one of the Hospital’s administration staff that he would be providing a Letter of Guarantee after which he searched for an AXA logo and forged what was purported to be a signature of a representative of AXA to obtain the surgery. The Hospital relied on this forgery into processing the accused’s surgery.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"/>63     With regard to the Defence’s argument that the accused had committed the forgery offence to escape the debilitating pain he was experiencing and had “no way to effectively manage his pain”, in my judgment this may have been rather overstated. In the Statement of Facts (taken from the medical report on the accused by Dr Ho Kok Yuen dated 30 March 2022) to which the accused had admitted to without qualification, it was stated that the accused could continue with his daily activities with some degree of low back pain <em>even if the surgery had not been performed</em>; and the surgical procedure (which was an elective procedure) could have been done at any hospital that has pain management specialists who could perform the surgery. In other words, it was not a situation where the accused had no option but to proceed with the surgery at the Hospital which led to the forgery charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"/>64     Turning to the harm in the present case, the amount which the Hospital had been cheated was the provision of medical services amounting to $20,892.72 and unlike <em>Seet Choo Mong</em>, the accused has made no restitution in the present case. As such, the harm that had been caused to the Hospital was quantifiable in terms of financial loss and was not insignificant. Further, the current case was similar to the situation in <em>Lim Ek Kian</em> where Yong CJ found at [36] that the offender’s actions were the sole reason for the victim’s loss. In the present case, the accused was the sole reason for the Hospital’s loss.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"/>65     As for offender specific factors, I note that the accused had one charge taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v UI</em> [2008] 4 SLR (R) 500 at [38]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">But, i<b>f there are TIC [note: refers to “taken into consideration”] offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased</b> (see <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 77). This is commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. <b>This would </b><b><em>a fortiori </em></b><b>be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature.</b></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"/>66     In the present case, the charge taken into consideration was an amalgamated charge of forgery for the purposes of cheating under s 468 Penal Code read with s 124(8) Criminal Procedure Code. This concerned the accused forging 11 prescriptions purportedly issued by various doctors in Singapore, between 30 September 2020 and 11 February 2021, intending that the prescriptions forged shall be used for the purpose of cheating. As such, this would be an aggravator factor and would have an enhancing impact on the proceeded forgery charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"/>67     As for mitigating factors, I noted that he had cooperated with the authorities and had pleaded guilty and was remorseful for his actions. While the Defence may have submitted that the accused was a first offender and had no antecedents, it should be borne in mind that he had committed multiple property offences between 30 September 2020 and April 2022 including some committed while he was on bail.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"/>68     For completeness, I did not consider the accused’s motive for the forgery as a mitigating factor but rather one that featured towards his culpability as earlier discussed. I also find that <em>Lai Oei Mui Jenny</em> did not assist the Defence in its submission that the fact that the accused did not make any financial gain or benefit from his crime was a “legitimate mitigating factor”. In this regard, it could not be said that the accused did not benefit at all. He did receive a benefit of a surgery amounting to $20,892.72 from the Hospital for his medical condition. In any event, Yong CJ had stated in <em>Lai Oei Mui Jenny</em> at [3] that such a factor carried very little weight:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Before this court, counsel for the appellant relied upon several arguments which had not been put before the District Court, when the appellant had been unrepresented. <b>She had made no financial gain and had in the past contributed voluntary public service. I considered these factors to be legitimate mitigating factors but of very little weight.</b></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"/>69     At the end of the day, I did not disagree with the Defence’s submission that the present offence was less aggravated than <em>Tang Wai Kit</em> (on the basis that the offender in <em>Tang Wai Kit</em> was motivated by greed) but more aggravating than <em>Seet Choo Mong</em> and <em>Candace Ang.</em> However, on the assessment of harm and culpability as well as the offender specific factors, I was of the view that the Defence, in its submission for a sentence for eight months’ imprisonment, had not sufficiently factored in the benefit that the accused had gained from the surgery, the consequential financial loss of $20,892.72 to the Hospital (for which no restitution had been made) and the amalgamated charge of 11 instances of forgery for the purposes of cheating which had been taken into consideration. I accordingly imposed a sentence of ten month’s imprisonment for the forgery charge, which was below the 12 month imprisonment benchmark sentence in <em>Lim Ek Kian</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The cheating charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"/>70     As for the cheating offences, both the Prosecution and the Defence were not far apart in their submissions on sentence. The Prosecution sought a sentence of one to two months’ imprisonment whilst the Defence sought a sentence of one months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"/>71     An offence under s 420 Penal Code carries a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 10 years and/or fine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"/>72     Whilst the amounts cheated from the two victims were not particularly large, I found it aggravating that the accused had committed the cheating offence whilst on bail. In <em>Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/55080-M.xml')">[2007] 4 SLR 753</a>, V K Rajah JA observed at para [57] that the commission of an offence whilst on bail for another, is itself an aggravating factor and “squarely and directly engages the two facets of deterrence.” In <em>Loo Pei Xiang Alan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17811-SSP.xml')">[2015] SGHC 217</a>, Chao JA observed at [29] that a good reason for elevating a sentence beyond its starting point is that the offences were committed while on bail which “demonstrates a disregard for law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"/>73     Further, given that the amount ($700) in one of the cheating charges (DAC 911294 of 2022) were more than three times the amount ($200) in the other charge (DAC 911295 of 2022), I was of the view a sentence of two months’ imprisonment should be imposed for DAC 911294 of 2022 and one month’s imprisonment for DAC 911295 of 2022.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consecutive sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"/>74     Under s 307(1) Criminal Procedure Code, as three terms of imprisonment had been imposed, I was required to run at least two of the imprisonment terms consecutively. I chose to run the imprisonment term for the forgery offence with the two months’ imprisonment term for the cheating charge as this involved cheating a victim of a significantly higher amount ($700) than the other cheating offence ($200).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"/>75     On a totality basis, I was of the view that the total sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment could not be said to be substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most of serious offences committed (both the forgery and cheating charges carried a maximum term of 10 years’ imprisonment) nor could it be said to be crushing.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"/>76     In conclusion, the sentences I imposed on the accused were as follows:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.56%"/><col width="21.3%"/><col width="22.44%"/><col width="24.36%"/><col width="21.34%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>S/No</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Charge No</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Offence</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Sentence</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2nd charge (DAC-916543-2021)</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Forgery for the purposes of cheating </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 468 Penal Code</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ten months’ imprisonment</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3rd charge (DAC-911294-2022)</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cheating</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 420 Penal Code</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two months’ imprisonment</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consecutive</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> </p> </td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4th charge (DAC-911295-2022)</p> </td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cheating</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 420 Penal Code</p> </td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One month’s imprisonment</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Concurrent</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"/>77     The accused was accordingly sentenced to a global sentence of 12 month’s imprisonment.
