It appeared that the Defence also agreed that this case fell within Band 2 of the sentencing framework. In reaching its proposed indicative starting sentence, the Defence cited two precedents, namely <em>PP v Rengasamy Manikandan</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26397-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 122</a> (“<em>Rengasamy</em>”) and the unreported decision in <em>PP v Kannan Sukumaran</em> (DAC-908559-2020) (“<em>Kannan</em>”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     The following is a summary of the two cases:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"/>(a)      <em><u>Rengasa</u></em> <em>my</em>. The offender in <em>Rengasamy</em> was convicted for an offence of aggravated OM after trial. He was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and an additional three months’ imprisonment <em>in lieu</em> of caning;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>It was submitted that the facts of this case were more egregious than the present case. The district judge had found a considerable degree of sexual exploitation which involved her private parts and the entire intrusion intense, intrusive and prolonged. Much force was used to wrongfully restrain the victim and the offender remained undeterred until members of the public came to her rescue. The victim in <em>Rengasamy</em> was also found to have suffered from psychological harm in addition to physical harm.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"/>(b)      <em><u>Kannan</u></em>. The offender in Kannan pleaded guilty to one charge of aggravated OM and was, like the offender in <em>Rengasamy</em>, sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and an additional three months’ imprisonment <em>in lieu</em> of caning.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The Defence submitted that the facts of this case bore some resemblance to the present case in terms of sexual exploitation and harm. The offender approached the victim from behind as she was jogging. He then used his right arm to grab the victim across her chest from behind and used his right hand to squeeze the victim’s left breast (over her clothes). The one aggravating factor was in <em>Kannan</em> was that the offender punched the victim once on her chest which caused her to fall to the ground and suffer a cut on her elbow.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     Based on this, the Defence submitted that the appropriate indicative starting sentence was four years’ imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     At this point in time, I should highlight an error in the Defence;s submission The offender in <em>Rengasamy</em> was not sentenced to four years’ imprisonment, with an additional three months’ imprisonment <em>in lieu</em> of caning as set out in the PIM at [6]. In fact, in <em>Rengasamy</em> at [51], the court was of the view that the appropriate sentence was five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. However, in <em>Rengasamy</em> at [61], the court explained that, as the accused had initially spent six months in remand before being bailed out, six months’ imprisonment was deducted from the sentence and a final sentence of four years’ and six months’ imprisonment, and six strokes of the cane was imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     The Defence conceded that the accused’s previous convictions for aggravated OM and OM warranted an uplift to the indicative starting sentence. Taking into account that the accused was suffering from Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and impaired vision in both eyes,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> the proposed sentence by the Defence was five years and three months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     The Defence agreed that, as the accused cannot be caned, due to his age, an additional term of three months’ imprisonment should be imposed <em>in lieu</em> of caning as the accused had used violence on the Victim in a public place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     Therefore, the final sentence submitted by the Defence was a sentence of five years’ imprisonment and six months’ imprisonment inclusive of the additional term of imprisonment <em>in lieu</em> of caning.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The punishment prescribed by law</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     The punishment prescribed by law upon conviction for a charge of aggravated OM is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Outraging modesty in certain circumstances</b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>354A-(1)</b> Whoever, in order to commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence against any person under section 354, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to that person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death, instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 10 years and with caning.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentencing framework for aggravated OM</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     I agree with and accept that the sentencing bands as pronounced in <em>BDA.</em> I note that both the Prosecution and Defence have also accepted this sentencing framework and have, in fact, used it to reach their proposed sentences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     I now consider the following offence-specific factors that are relevant and featured in the present case. Per <em>GBR</em> at [27] – [30], these are, the degree of sexual exploitation, the circumstances of the offence, and the harm caused to the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Degree of sexual exploitation</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     This requires a consideration of where (as in which part of the body), how and for how long the victim was touched.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     I do not disagree with what was highlighted by the Prosecution at [8(a)] of the PAS. The accused not only grabbed the Victim’s breast but continued to do so for about one minute when his hand was underneath her body after they fell on the floor. This is not a fleeting touch but was of quite substantial duration. It is within the realms of possibility that this touching could have persisted for a longer period of time had the Victim’s screams not attracted several passers-by who went over to assist her. Nonetheless, I accepted the Defence’s submission that the degree of sexual exploitation was not as egregious as that in <em>Rengasamy</em></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The circumstances of the offence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     Likewise, I do not disagree with what was highlighted by the Prosecution at [8(b)] of the PAS. The level of premeditation in the present case was far more extensive than in <em>Rengasamy</em>. The accused had followed the Victim all the way from Changi Airport MRT station to the condominium where she lived. This required the accused to follow the Victim through two different MRT lines and a bus ride. He tried to speak to her on the bus but was rebuffed. He then followed her off the bus. The accused then took advantage of the situation when the Victim was momentarily inattentive to her surroundings as she searched for her keys in her bag. He then attacked her by hugging her from behind before grabbing her right breast over her dress with his right hand.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Harm to the Victim</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     In the present case, there is nothing to show that the Victim suffered any psychological injury. I note that the physical injuries suffered by the Victim are minor. It would appear that these injuries were mainly caused when the Victim fell face forward onto the ground during the course of the struggle. I agreed that the harm caused was less than the victim in <em>Rengasamy</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Indicative starting sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     In <em>GBR</em> at [33], the High Court held that where two or more aggravating factors are present, the case will almost invariably fall within Band 2 and caning will nearly always be imposed. In the present case, there were clearly more than two aggravating factors present. These factors included the touching of a victim’s private parts and the accused’s level of premeditation. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution and the Defence that the presence of these factors would place the case clearly within Band 2 of the sentencing framework, giving sentencing range of between four to seven years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     In <em>GBR</em> at [33], the High Court also held that, <em>“at the lower end of the band would be cases in which there was an absence of skin-to-skin contact with the private parts of the victim</em>”. Accordingly, from the facts of the case, I agreed that this case, given the absence of skin-to-skin contact, fell at the lower end of Band 2 of the sentencing framework. I therefore adjudged that the indicative starting sentence in the present case to be four years’ imprisonment, and being in Band 2, six strokes of the cane. This is also in line with the Prosecution’s and Defence’s assessment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Aggravating factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     The accused is a recalcitrant recidivist. As mentioned, he has numerous antecedents and these date back to 1986 when he was still a juvenile. His antecedents include two previous convictions for similar offences of OM. In May 2003, he was convicted on one count of aggravated OM and was sentenced to five years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. His most recent OM conviction was on 11 September 2009, when he was convicted, amongst other charges, on two counts of aggravated OM and one count of OM. He was sentenced to ten years’ Corrective Training and seven strokes of the cane. Despite this long period of incarceration, it did not deter him from committing further OM offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     In fact, the accused did not even stay crime free for long. Less than six months after his release from prison, in February 2020, the accused committed an offence of housebreaking. He was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment with effect from 6 March 2020. He therefore committed the present offence of aggravated OM less than a year after being released. Accordingly, I was of the view that the present offence warranted a substantial uplift from the indicative starting sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     The Prosecution had proposed an uplift of one and a half years’ imprisonment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. The Defence conceded that an uplift from the indicative starting sentence would be appropriate but instead, proposed an uplift of one year and three months’ imprisonment to give a sentence of five years’ and three months’ imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     In light of the factors that I have highlighted above, I adjudged that the appropriate uplift in the present case to be two years’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mitigating factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     I am of the view that the only mitigating factor in the present case is the fact that the accused has chosen to plead guilty at the first available opportunity.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     The Defence had highlighted that the accused was suffering from Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and impaired vision in both eyes and this was a mitigating factor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Having considered the two medical reports put forward by the Defence, I adjudged that very little weight should be placed on the accused’s medical condition(s) as a mitigating factor. For example, I note that at [29(c)) of the medical report from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) dated 11 November 2021, Dr Lim Shang Cong opined that there was no contributory link between the accused’s mental condition and the offence. In fact, it is the doctor’s opinion that the accused was likely to have been intoxicated around the time of the offence due to alcohol consumption along with tablets of Valium obtained from the black market and his IMH medication.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     I was therefore of the view that a downward adjustment of no more than six months’ imprisonment was appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     Accordingly, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence at this stage of my assessment was five years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence of imprisonment in lieu of caning</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     Both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that, as the accused is ineligible to be caned due to his age, an additional term of imprisonment ought to be imposed <em>in lieu</em> of caning. Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the appropriate sentence was three month’s imprisonment <em>in lieu</em> of caning.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the sentence should be enhanced</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     In <em>Amin</em> the High Court held the appropriate starting point is that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there were grounds to justify doing so. The factors included the need to compensate for the deterrent and retributive effect of caning loss by the exemption (per <em>Amin</em> at [53 and [59])</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     At [63] in <em>Amin</em>, it was highlighted that deterrence is likely to be the dominant sentencing consideration behind the imposition of caning for offences impacting public order and social safety. This is exactly how the offence of aggravated OM could be characterized as. The offence was committed in a public place, as the Victim was walking home. Moreover, the incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, with few people around.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"/>53     The accused’s offence of aggravated OM was particularly reprehensible. So was the manner in which it was committed. He effectively stalked the Victim on her entire journey home and attacked her in that brief moment when she was not paying attention to her surroundings. Women should be able feel safe walking anywhere in public at any time of the day without fearing that they would be molested, more so being physically restraint when such an act is committed on them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"/>54     I further note that, more pertinently, the accused had received sentences of caning for his two previous aggravated OM convictions. Despite being previously caned, this had failed to deter him. Specific deterrence is therefore paramount in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"/>55     Accordingly, I agreed that there should be an enhancement to the sentence <em>in lieu</em> of caning. This additional term of imprisonment would be effective in replacing the deterrent and retributive effect of caning that had been lost because of the accused’s age.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Duration of the enhancement</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"/>56     The court in <em>Amin</em> was of the view that the extent of such enhancement should have some correlation to the number of strokes of the cane that an offender has been exempted from. At [90], the court set out the following indicative guidelines:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="39.9%"/><col width="60.1%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Strokes avoided</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Enhancement</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to six strokes</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to three months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Seven to 12 strokes</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to six months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 to 18 strokes</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">six to nine months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">More than 19 strokes</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Nine to 12 months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"/>57     In my view, the facts of this case warranted an enhancement of a sentence at the upper end of the indicative sentencing range of “<em>up to three months’ imprisonment</em>”. Therefore, the proposed enhancement by the Prosecution of three months’ imprisonment <em>in lieu</em> of the six strokes of the cane imposed was not inappropriate. As mentioned, a similar view was held by the Defence, and appropriately so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Final sentence imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"/>58     Therefore, the final sentence imposed on the accused is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>Five years’ and nine months’ imprisonment</b>, <b><em>inclusive of three months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning</em></b></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"/>59     In addition, I ordered that this sentence of imprisonment was to commence with effect from 25 October 2021, the date that the accused was arrested. He has been remanded since then as he had been unable to raise bail.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"/>60     The accused is a recalcitrant offender. In view of his similar antecedents, and the manner in which the offence was committed, the sentence imposed on the accused was fair and appropriate. The Defence was in general agreement with a proposed sentence of four years’ and six months’ imprisonment inclusive of three months’ imprisonment <em>in lieu</em> of caning. He does not deserve a lower sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"/>61     All considered, the sentence imposed could not be said to be manifestly excessive. However, the accused is dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, and he has, in person, filed a Notice of Appeal against sentence. The accused is presently serving sentence.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Prosecution’s Address on Sentence (“PAS”) at [6].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>See summary of the accused’s previous convictions at [15] of these Grounds, above.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>PAS at [8].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Plea in Mitigation (“PIM”) from [6] to [10].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>PIM at [11].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_6_1" id="Ftn_6">[note: 6]</a></sup>See medical reports from IMH dated 11 November 2021 and CGH dated 21 September 2022.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_7_1" id="Ftn_7">[note: 7]</a></sup>PAS at [7].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_8_1" id="Ftn_8">[note: 8]</a></sup>PIM at [16].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_9_1" id="Ftn_9">[note: 9]</a></sup>PIM at [15].</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_10_1" id="Ftn_10">[note: 10]</a></sup>PIM at [20].</p></div></content></root> </div> <form name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm" action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap10 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner" > <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
