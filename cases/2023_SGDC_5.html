The Reformative Training (RT) suitability report called for prior to sentencing found the Accused physically and mentally suitable for reformative training at Level Two intensity i.e. a minimum of 12 months detention in an RT centre. Notwithstanding the recommendation in the RT report, I imposed the following sentences:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>DAC 905563/2022 - 36 months' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>DAC 906510/2022 - Three months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       The imprisonment terms were ordered to run concurrently. The total sentence was: 36 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, backdated to 7 April 2022 when he was arrested.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       This is the Accused’s appeal against the sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statement of Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       In order to appreciate the full facts of the case, I have reproduced the Statement of Facts in the following paragraphs. The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused and accomplice</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       The Accused is Muhammad Sajid s/o Saleem (“Accused”), a 20-year-old male Singaporean bearing NRIC number: XXX. His co-accused is Niswan s/o Thiruchelvam (“Niswan”), a 19-year-old male Singaporean at the material time. He is the Accused’s friend and they were both members of the ‘Ang Soon Tong’ secret society (“the Secret Society”) of the ‘Ji It’ Group, an unlawful society as defined under s 14(1) of the Societies Act (Chapter 311, 2014 Rev Ed), operating at Block 346A, Kang Ching Road, Singapore with parental operational ground at Taman Jurong Market.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Victims</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       The victims are:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"/>a)     Praveen Raj s/o Chanthiran (“Praveen”), a 23-year-old male Singaporean at the material time; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"/>b)     Sarankumar s/o Subramaniam (“Saran”), a 22-year-old male Singaporean at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">First Information Report </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       On 6 April 2022, at about 5.03pm, a complainant called “999” to inform that “There is a couple with parang chasing one guy”.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Background Information </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     The Accused and Niswan met each other in 2016. They became friends thereafter. Sometime after July 2020, the Accused and Niswan found out from each other that they were both members of the Secret Society and they became closer friends. They agreed that if either of them had any disputes with third parties, they would support each other.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     Sometime in February 2022, the Accused’s girlfriend at the material time was messaging Praveen, which infuriated the Accused. The Accused contacted Praveen to tell him not to contact his girlfriend. The Accused and Praveen communicated through phone calls with each other and there were some verbal disputes in the following weeks due to jealousy over the Accused’s girlfriend and other personal issues. Sometime in late March 2022, Praveen and the Accused again argued with each other during a phone call. The Accused planned an attack against Praveen.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Facts Pertaining to DAC 905563/2022</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     On 5 April 2022, sometime at night, the Accused met Niswan for dinner. After dinner, both were relaxing at a void deck of a Woodlands block. The Accused told Niswan that he wanted to carry out an attack on Praveen in Boon Lay. The Accused told Niswan that he knew Praveen would be in the vicinity of Boon Lay Drive on 6 April 2022 as Praveen will be attending wedding celebrations of a mutual friend Emmanuel s/o Ravi (“Emmanuel”, who is the groom of the wedding) who resides in Boon Lay. Niswan agreed to join the Accused in this attack. On 5 April 2022, the Accused and Niswan purchased two bread knives to use in the attack the following day. The Accused brought back the knives to his house and kept them. The knives’ blades are about 23.5cm long.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     On 6 April 2022, the Accused and Niswan met up in the morning to plan the attack. They drank some beer. They then retrieved the knives from the Accused’s house and concealed the knives underneath the waistband of their pants. On 6 April 2022, at about 3.45pm, the Accused and Niswan arrived at Block 175, Boon Lay Drive, Singapore and waited for Praveen to arrive at the vicinity. They consumed another can of beer and tracked Praveen’s movements through Praveen’s social media posts. The Accused and Niswan were each armed with a bread knife. At about 4.50pm, they spotted Praveen and Saran exiting a vehicle in the carpark vicinity of Block 175, Boon Lay Drive, Singapore. Praveen’s multiple friends (including females) also alighted from the vehicle. They had just returned from the wedding celebrations and they intended to continue the wedding celebrations at Emmanuel’s block.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     At about 5.03pm, at the vicinity of the said carpark, the Accused and Niswan immediately ran towards Praveen. The Accused swung the knife towards Praveen’s head but Praveen blocked the attack with his hands. The Accused slashed Praveen’s hand. Niswan also slashed Praveen’s hand. Saran, who was nearby, shouted at both of them to stop attacking Praveen. The Accused and Niswan then turned their attention to Saran. The Accused was nearer to Saran, and he slashed Saran on his head<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Praveen attempted to flee as he was slashed. The Accused and Niswan chased him and this time, both slashed Praveen on the upper torso and hands outside the coffeeshop of Block 175.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     Praveen again attempted to flee and managed to reach a walkway near the main road of Block 175. The Accused caught up with Praveen and kicked him which resulted in Praveen falling down. The Accused and Niswan slashed Praveen’s head and torso again. While Praveen was on the ground, they also kicked him multiple times. In total, there were three separate locations in the vicinity of Block 175, Boon Lay Drive, Singapore that Praveen was attacked by the two of them resulting in multiple slash wounds. The attack took place near the carpark, outside a coffeeshop area and also a walkway near a main road. Both of them had aimed their weapons at Praveen’s head and body during the slashing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     After they ended their attack on Praveen, the Accused and Niswan saw Emmanuel in the said carpark vicinity. Emmanuel was shocked and asked them why they had to do this on his wedding day and ruin the wedding. At about 5.10pm, Niswan then pointed his knife at Emmanuel in a threatening manner and wanted to slash him. Emmanuel felt alarmed and feared for his life. The Accused pulled Niswan back as he did not have any prior dispute with Emmanuel and did not want to harm Emmanuel. The two of them fled the scene and disposed their knives in a rubbish chute in the Jurong vicinity. The knives were not recovered.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     Members of public saw the vicious attacks and the Police were called. The Accused and Niswan took a private hire vehicle to Woodlands. They went to a mutual friend’s place and the mutual friend gave the Accused a change of clothes so that the Accused could avoid Police detection. By that night, videos of the incident had gone viral on social media and a manhunt was launched to arrest the Accused and Niswan. Both of them knew that it was a matter of time before they were arrested and they surrendered to the Police the next day.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     Praveen and Saran were conveyed to National University hospital (“NUH”) on the same day. According to a medical report from NUH dated 26 August 2022<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, Praveen suffered the following injuries:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"/>a)     Right temporal incised wound 3cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"/>b)     Forehead incised wound 5cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"/>c)     Left deltoid incised wound 8cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"/>d)     Left elbow incised wound 2cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_e"/>e)     Left mid forearm incised wound 3cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_f"/>f)     Left wrist incised wound 4cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_g"/>g)     Left index finger incised wound 1cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_h"/>h)     Right elbow incised wound 4cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_i"/>i)     Right arm incised wound 3cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_j"/>j)     Right hand incised wound 8cm;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_k"/>k)     Right middle finger incised wound 1cm; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_l"/>l)     Right flank incised wound 1 cm.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     X-ray also revealed the following:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"/>a)     Undisplaced fracture of the left distal ulna;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"/>b)     Minimally displaced fracture of the left index finger distal phalanx;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"/>c)     Undisplaced fracture of the right distal humerus.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     According to a further medical report from NUH dated 29 August 2022<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, Praveen suffered the following injuries:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"/>a)     On his left upper limb:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_i"/>i)       Posterior arm laceration;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_ii"/>ii)       Posterior elbow laceration with partially cut triceps tendons;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_iii"/>iii)       Forearm laceration with partially cut extensor carpi ulnaris tendon and unicortical breach of ulnar shaft;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_iv"/>iv)       Wrist dorsoulnar laceration with completely cut extensor carpi ulnaris tendon and unicortical break of ulnar neck;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_v"/>v)       Index finger laceration with cut digital nerve and distal phalanx fracture.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"/>b)     On his right upper limb:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_vi"/>vi)       Posterior shoulder and lateral arm lacerations;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_vii"/>vii)       Lateral elbow laceration with partially cut triceps and brachioradialis muscle;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_viii"/>viii)       Hypothenar laceration with cut ulnar nerve (deep branch partially cut, superficial branch 100% cut) and cut ulnar artery, ulnar sagittal band to little finger 10% cut;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_ix"/>ix)       Middle finger partially cut terminal extensor tendon;</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_x"/>x)       Ring finger nail plate avulsion injury.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     Praveen underwent the following surgeries:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"/>a)     Exploratory debridgement of bilateral upper limb wounds on 7 April 2022;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"/>b)     Left index finger distal phalangeal wiring, radial digital nerve repair, extensor carpi ulnaris repair, triceps insertion repair, right hand repair of ulnar nerve and ulnar artery, closure of wounds on 12 April 2022;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"/>c)     Left index finger removal of implants on 17 May 2022.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     Praveen was hospitalized from 6 April 2022 to 14 April 2022 and 17 May 2022.

On examination, there was a 8cm left temporal scalp linear laceration. A further medical report from NUH dated 14 September 2022 confirmed that he had laceration of the scalp.

The Accused admitted that he was a member of the said secret society.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     The Accused committed both the offences while on police bail. He surrendered on 7 April 2022 and was charged in Court on 9 April 2022.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Approach to Sentencing Young Offenders</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     The Accused was under 21 years old at the time of the offences and when he pleaded guilty to the charges.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     Where young offenders are concerned, the approach to sentencing is well-established. It involves a two-step approach as set out in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a> (“<em>Al-Ansari</em> framework<em>”</em>) and elaborated upon in <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz (“Boaz”)</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a>. The approach was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v ASR</em> [2019] SLR 941 and reiterated in <em>See Li Quan Mendel v Public Prosecutor (“Mendel”)</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24704-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGCA 61</a>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     As succinctly put in [28] of <em>Boaz:</em></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>“It is well established that when a court sentences a youthful offender, it approaches the task in two distinct but related stages (PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a> (“PP v Al-Ansari”) at [77]–[78]). At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     Having regard to the first stage of the <em>Al-Ansari</em> framework which required the Court to consider all the circumstances of the case when coming to a final determination as to whether rehabilitation remained the primary sentencing consideration<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, I called for an RT report.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defence’s Mitigation/Submissions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     The Accused was found physically and mentally fit for reformative training and a Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation was recommended.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     Defence Counsel urged the Court to impose a term of reformative training on the Accused. In his mitigation, most of which centred on the circumstances surrounding the commission of the section 326 Penal Code offence, Defence Counsel highlighted that the Accused had pleaded guilty, demonstrating genuine remorse for his actions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. He had also turned himself in to authorities at the “<em>earliest instance</em>” and co-operated with the police<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. Explaining the circumstances leading to the offence under section 326 Penal Code, Defence Counsel stated that the Accused had been “<em>instigated</em>” by the victim (referring to Praveen), over a period of time. During one of the many exchanges over the phone in March 2022, Praveen had hurled insults at the Accused’s step-mother who is deaf and dumb and had also used multiple expletives and vulgarities against the Accused during a phone conversation in March 2022. The Accused felt compelled to retaliate<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     Defence Counsel submitted that the Accused’s reformative prospects were “<em>relatively good</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. That being so, rehabilitation may not be outweighed by the need for deterrence despite the gravity of the offence committed by the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. Further, even in serious offences such as drug-related offences, armed robbery on a public bus or causing hurt by a dangerous weapon, courts have held that rehabilitation remained a dominant sentencing consideration<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     Defence Counsel submitted that the principle of rehabilitation was “<em>arguably diminished but not eclipsed in the sentencing matrix</em>”. From the RT report, it could be seen that the Accused was amenable to reform and his positive attitude and personal circumstances along with a conducive family environment showed that he had “<em>some form of rehabilitative prospects</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. Defence Counsel strongly urged the Court to impose a term of RT on the Accused - a sentence which encapsulated the twin principles of rehabilitation and deterrence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reasons for the Sentence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     I was unable to accept the submissions of Defence Counsel.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     The fact that rehabilitation remained a consideration even if not the dominant one (thus making reformative training a viable sentence) was squarely rejected by the High Court in <em>Mendel</em>’s case<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. As stated in <em>Mendel</em> at [13]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>At the first stage of the Al-Ansari framework, once rehabilitation has been displaced as the dominant sentencing consideration, as for instance in this case by reason of the gravity of the offence and the harm caused, the dominant consideration almost necessarily turns to deterrence. By this point, reformative training is no longer an appropriate option. It bears reiterating that reformative training lies within the spectrum of rehabilitative sentences (Al-Ansari at [75]; Public Prosecutor v Ong Jack Hong <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19524-SSP.xml')">[2016] 5 SLR 166</a> at [11]; ASR at [134]; see also Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) at p 53). Between reformative training and probation, reformative training is the better choice for a young offender for whom rehabilitation remains the principal consideration, but who also needs a measure of deterrence. But where, as in this case, rehabilitation has been displaced as the dominant sentencing consideration, reformative training ceases ordinarily to be a viable option and the appropriate sentences must be the legislatively prescribed options such as imprisonment and caning.”</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     The Court in <em>Boaz</em>, at [30] stated that “<em>the focus on rehabilitation can be diminished or even eclipsed by such considerations as deterrence or retribution where the circumstances warrant. Broadly speaking, this happens in cases where (a) the offence is serious, (b) the harm caused is severe, (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant, or (d) the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable”.</em></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rehabilitation had been Displaced as the Dominant Sentencing Principle</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     At the first stage of the <em>Al-Ansari</em> framework., I found that rehabilitation had been displaced as the dominant sentencing consideration in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Gravity of the Offence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     The offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon was an extremely serious one. The punishment prescribed for such an offence under section 326 of the Penal Code was imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment which may extend to 15 years, and the offender may also be liable to fine or to caning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     The offence itself aside, the circumstances in which the Accused had committed the grievous hurt were horrifying. He had brandished his 23.5 cm-long-blade bread knife in public, swung it at Praveen’s head the moment he saw him and used it to slash Praveen’s hand. With knife in hand, the Accused gave chase when Praveen attempted to flee and he continued to use the knife to slash Praveen on his upper torso and hands. The Accused was relentless in his attack as he continued to pursue Praveen, and along with Niswan (the co-accused), they slashed his head and torso again. As mentioned in the Statement of Facts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>, there was a total of three separate locations in the vicinity of Block 175 Boon Lay Drive that Praveen was attacked, resulting in multiple slash wounds. These were near the carpark, outside a coffeeshop and also a walkway near a main road, in a residential neighbourhood, in broad daylight. The use of violence by the Accused was both blatant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> and brazen<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Culpability of the Accused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     The manner in which the Accused had planned the attack was also highly premeditated. The Accused was aware that Praveen would be attending the wedding of a mutual friend, Emmanuel on 6 April 2022. He enlisted the help of the co-accused Niswan in the attack and deliberately purchased two bread knives for use in the attack<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. On the day in question, the Accused and Niswan concealed the knives in the waistband of their pants, tracked Praveen’s movements through his social media account and laid in wait for Praveen in the vicinity of Block 175 Boon Lay Drive. This was not an attack on a victim which arose from spontaneous events or an event which happened on the spur of the moment, but one which was carefully planned and executed by the Accused. The Accused’s level of culpability was high.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Severity of the Harm Caused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     The vicious nature of the Accused’s attacks, in common intention with Niswan, was manifested by the extent of injury suffered by Praveen. The medical reports<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> documented the severity of harm caused to Praveen, which included three fractures and multiple lacerations all over his body. He underwent several surgeries and was hospitalized for about 10 days, with hospitalization leave for 118 days (including his hospitalization).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     Bearing the circumstances of this case in mind, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was a strong need for deterrence. There was much public disquiet as the Accused’s violent acts which took place in an HDB<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> estate in broad daylight, were captured on video and circulated widely online. Prosecution submitted that offences of this type created deep public disquiet and deterrent sentences were necessary to prevent the proliferation of such offences. There was also a need to send a message to future youthful offenders in public who act similarly. I shared the view that a strong deterrent sentence was necessary to signal the Courts’ disapprobation of the conduct of the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Accused’s Antecedents</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     Whilst I was constantly mindful that the Accused was 20 years old when he committed this offence (and there would ordinarily be a presumptive emphasis on rehabilitation), I noted from his antecedents that this young man has had several opportunities for rehabilitation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     Prior to the offence, the Accused had been placed on probation twice. On 27 September 2017, when he was only 15 years old, the Accused was ordered to undergo 21 months’ probation for two counts of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code. On 3 June 2020, the Accused was again ordered to undergo probation for 21 months, for being a member of an unlawful assembly under section 143 of the Penal Code. An additional charge of rioting was taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing on that occasion.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     The Accused’s history of offending did not start at 15 years old. As pointed out by the Prosecution, at the tender age of 12, the Accused was already involved in a fight outside school where he was issued a police warning. At 14 years old, he committed an offence of wilful trespass and was given a 12-month conditional warning and placed on the Guidance Programme. Thereafter, as his antecedents reflect, the Accused was placed on two rounds of probation. Even whilst on probation, he received several verbal, written and court warnings for breaching time restriction. On one of these occasions, he committed a fresh offence of rioting. On his second term of probation (for rioting and for being a member of an unlawful assembly), the Accused again failed to abide by his time restriction and was involved in a fight in February 2021, for which he was given a warning<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     Subsequent to the second order of probation, the Accused went on to commit an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code - that of causing hurt – which formed the subject matter of one of the charges now taken into consideration (MAC 905948/2022). Whilst he was on police bail for the TIC offence, he committed this current offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with dangerous weapon, against two victims – Praveen and Saran. After being charged in court and released on bail, the Accused breached his bail conditions. At that point, bail was no longer offered to the Accused<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. Accused was in remand when he pleaded guilty to the charges before this court. The Accused’s history of offending and persistent disregard of the law plainly showed him to be recalcitrant.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Deterrence was the Dominant Sentencing Principle</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     Taking into account all the circumstances of this case, in my final determination at the first stage of the <em>Al-Ansari</em> framework, I was satisfied that deterrence had displaced rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration. Since rehabilitation was not the dominant sentencing consideration, reformative training, which in essence is a rehabilitative sentence, was no longer an appropriate sentencing option.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     In proposing the framework in <em>Al-Ansari</em>, the Court stated at [77], that “<em>if the offence was particularly heinous or the offender has a long history of offending, then reform and rehabilitation may not even be possible or relevant, notwithstanding the youth of the offender. In this case, the statutorily prescribed punishment (in most cases a term of imprisonment) will be appropriate</em>”. This was one such case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     The fact that in some precedent cases, courts have held that rehabilitation remains a dominant sentencing consideration despite the gravity of the offence committed by the young offender, was not a compelling argument for this Court to find that rehabilitation remained the main focus of sentencing in this case<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. The gravity of the offence is only but one aspect of a total and holistic consideration of all circumstances of the case in order to arrive at a final determination of what the dominant sentencing consideration ought to be.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     In the case of <em>Muhammad Zuhairie Adely Bin Zulkifli</em> (“<em>Adely”</em>) <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19149-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 134</a>, a case heavily relied on by Defence Counsel where on appeal the court imposed a term of reformative training in place of imprisonment on an offender convicted of a similar offence under section 326 Penal Code, the circumstances may be distinguished. In <em>Adely</em>, the offender was only 17 years of age at the time of the offence; he was also untraced. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the offender was the lone attacker and there were no injuries on the face of the victim<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     Further and in reference to <em>Adely</em>, the Court of Appeal in <em>Mendel</em> took the opportunity at [14] to clarify the proposition “<em>that at the first stage of the Al-Ansari framework, reformative training may still be an option even for young offenders for whom the primacy of rehabilitation had been provisionally displaced, but who showed a somewhat less exceptional capacity for reform than would be required to qualify for probation</em>”, was not a correct one. It was reiterated that rehabilitation must remain the dominant sentencing consideration at the first stage of the <em>Al-Ansari</em> framework before the court may consider whether probation or reformative training or some other type or combination of community-based sentence would be the correct way to achieve this<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     On the reasons as elaborated above, I was satisfied that deterrence had come to the fore as the dominant sentencing consideration in this case; not rehabilitation. Reformative training was therefore, not a viable sentencing option for the Court.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appropriate Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 326 of the Penal Code</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"/>53     The Prosecution submitted for an imprisonment term of 36 months and six strokes of the cane for the offence under section 326 of the Penal Code, given the serious injuries on the victim, the planned nature of the attack, the effect of the TIC charges and the Accused’s antecedents<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"/>54     In my mind, the sentence proposed by the Prosecution was more than fair. The precedents referred to by the Prosecution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> revealed a sentencing range of 36 months’ imprisonment upwards.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"/>55     Taking the approach in <em>Public Prosecutor v Miya Manik</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24833-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 164</a> (“<em>Miya Manik</em>”), where the Court first considered the indicative sentence if the charge had been under s 325 of the Penal Code before giving an uplift for the nature of the dangerous weapon used, and subsequently adjusting the sentence according to the aggravating and mitigating factors<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, the sentence which the Accused faced would have been much higher than 36 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"/>56     The Court of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v BDB</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21072-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGCA 69</a> (“BDB”) at [56] indicated that in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of multiple fractures (viz, fractures to the left elbow, left calf, and left 8th to 11th ribs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months. The indicative starting point might be higher or lower depending on the type and seriousness of the injuries caused. In view of the injuries Praveen suffered which consisted of lacerations and wounds on his head, face, limbs and fractures on his left hand, left finger and right elbow as well as an extensive hospitalization leave, the indicative starting sentence under section 325 of the Penal Code, would likely have been in excess of three years and six months’ imprisonment, or minimally, not less than three years and six months’ imprisonment. At this first step in <em>Miya Manik</em>, the uplift for the type of weapon used and the aggravating factors had not even featured.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"/>57     That said, I was mindful that the Accused had committed the offence when he was under 21 years old. He had surrendered himself to the authorities and pleaded guilty. Along with caning which I considered necessary to impose given the aggravating nature of the attack and the severe harm caused, I was of the view that the composite sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane would be sufficient for this young man.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 14(3) Societies Act</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"/>58     As submitted by the Prosecution, the usual sentencing range for such an offence is two to three months’ imprisonment. The Accused was a member of ‘Ang Soon Tong’ Triad Society from 1 July 2020 until his date of arrest for the offence under section 326 of the Penal Code. He was a fighter in the organization<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. I was of the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Total Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"/>59     I ordered both the imprisonment sentences to run concurrently, making it a total of 36 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. I was satisfied that the sentence was not manifestly excessive and was proportionate to the Accused’s culpability and criminality in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"/>60     The co-accused in this case, Niswan, pleaded guilty to similar charges as the Accused - under section 326 of the Penal Code and section 14(3) of the Societies Act – along with one other charge of criminal intimidation under section 506 of the Penal Code and three other traffic-related offences<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. As with the Accused, I did not consider reformative training a viable sentencing option and I proceeded to impose the same sentence on each of the charges for Niswan.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"/>61     The sentence was backdated to 7 April 2022 when the Accused was arrested. I further directed the prisons to take into account the periods of remand and to exclude the bail period<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>.
