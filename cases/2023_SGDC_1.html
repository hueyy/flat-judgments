<b><em>Statement of Facts</em></b> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">BACKGROUND</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Accused is Theophileous Jebaraj, a 19-year-old male Singaporean (DOB: 27/12/2002) bearing NRIC XXX</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">FACTS RELATING TO THE 4TH CHARGE: DAC-910381-2022</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sometime in June 2014, the Accused became acquainted with one “Mottai”, who the Accused knew was a member of the “Ang Soon Tong” triad society of the “Ji It” group operating at Blk 303 Jurong East Street 32, Singapore (“AST 303”). The Accused asked “Mottai” whether he could join AST 303. “Mottai” agreed, and so the Accused was accepted into AST 303 by “Mottai” and given the rank of “Fighter”. The Accused remained a member of AST 303 at all material times.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">AST 303 is not a registered society in Singapore under the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed) (the “SA”) and is thus an unlawful society.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 14(3) of the SA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">FACTS RELATING TO THE 6TH CHARGE: DAC-910819-2022</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The co-accused is Hannah d/o Sheik, a 19-year-old female Singaporean. At all material times, she and the Accused were friends.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The complainant is Chai Woon Hor, a 32-year-old male Malaysian national.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sometime between September 2021 and November 2021, the Accused contacted the co-accused through the Instagram Direct Message messaging service offering $300 for her NRIC and the password to her Singpass account (collectively, her “Singpass Details”), telling her that he would convey her Singpass Details to someone else who would use them. The co-accused agreed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subsequently, the Accused told the co-accused to delete his communication over Direct Message on Instagram with her and that they would communicate via the Telegram encrypted messaging service instead. The co-accused deleted the chats on Instagram as directed.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The co-accused disclosed via Telegram her Singpass Details to the Accused. Having done so, she asked the Accused when she would be paid. The Accused told her to wait and asked her to refer her friends to him so that he could obtain their Singpass Details as well; if she failed to do so, he would only pay her $200 instead of the $300 initially promised. The co-accused did not refer her friends to the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The following day, the Accused told the co-accused that she would receive a one-time password (“OTP”) to access her Singpass account, and asked her to send this OTP to him via Telegram. The co-accused did so. Thereafter, the Accused paid her $200.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 4 and 5 November 2021, Standard Chartered bank account XXX (the “SCB Account”) and HSBC bank account XXX and were opened using the co-accused’s Singpass Details. A total of $196,577 was credited into the HSBC account and $196,619 was transferred out of the account. A total of $3,030 was transferred into the SCB account and $2,922.79 was transferred out of the account.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 4 November 2021 at 11.58 pm, the complainant reported to the police that he was the victim of an online scam, and that as part of this scam, he was asked to transfer monies into the SCB Account, although he did not do so.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 8(2) read with section 10(1) of the CMA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">During investigations, the police were unable to retrieve the communications deleted because of the Accused’s actions as described at [7.].</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">FACTS RELATING TO THE 1ST CHARGE: DAC-923002-2021</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The co-accused is Joel Elliot Andrew, a 21-year-old male Singaporean (“Joel”). At the material time, he was also a member of AST 303 and was released on supervision from reformative training.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The victim is Ahamed Bazeer, a 37-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he did not know the Accused or Joel.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The involved parties are:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    Segu Jamaldeen Nafil Mohamed, a 28-year-old male Singaporean;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    Navinesh s/o Segar, a 20-year-old male Singaporean; and</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.    Roshan s/o Raja, a 19-year-old male Singaporean.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the material time, the involved parties were all also members of AST 303.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The complainant is Yogaraj K Rajendran, a male Singaporean. He is a member of the public and had witnessed the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 5 May 2021, the Accused was released on supervision from reformative training, under which he was fitted with a GPS tag and was required to reside at Blk 180 Bishan Street 13 #XXX between 11pm to 6am daily.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 14 November 2021, sometime in the afternoon, the Accused and the co-accused hung out together. At one point, they started talking about the victim. They bore grudges towards him and believed he owed them money. The Accused also thought the victim had belittled his secret society, and the co-accused had previously fought with the victim. They realised that that evening, he would be attending a wedding at the Sri Ruthra Kaliamman temple at 100 Depot Road, Singapore. They agreed to attack the victim with knives there, and to this end agreed to first meet in the vicinity of Ang Mo Kio, Singapore where they would buy knives.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">At about 8.45 pm, the Accused and the co-accused met in the vicinity of Ang Mo Kio Ave 8, Singapore. The Accused purchased two knives with serrated edges, which are instruments for stabbing or cutting, from a nearby shop; when doing so, he told the shop staff that he was buying the knives for his mother. After purchasing the two knives, the Accused had them wrapped in newspaper and kept them concealed in a red plastic bag.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having purchased the knives, the Accused and the co-accused took a private-hire car to the said temple, where they arrived at about 9.20 pm. When they alighted from the private-hire car, the Accused passed one of the knives to the co-accused. They both concealed their knives in the jeans they were wearing, and walked along Depot Walk, Singapore looking for the victim. At about 9.29 pm, they spotted the victim talking with other people at the end of Depot Walk, Singapore. Upon spotting the victim, they brandished the knives and ran towards him. The victim ran away towards Depot Road, and they gave chase. The victim fell at one point. The Accused and co-accused slashed him when he fell but the victim managed to get up and run away. They chased the victim from Depot Road to Depot Lane, and then into and out of a coffeeshop at Blk 118 Depot Lane, Singapore, where there were several patrons present. While chasing the victim, the Accused and the co-accused slashed the victim’s back. After they reached the said coffeeshop, the victim slowed down and eventually fell onto a grass patch in front of the coffeeshop. While he was there, the Accused slashed the victim on his head several times, and the co-accused slashed the victim several times on his limbs and body. They slashed the victim until he lost consciousness. The slashing took place in full view of other members of the public. They only stopped when the co-accused told the Accused that they should stop and flee. The Accused and the co-accused then ran to the HDB blocks opposite the coffeeshop where they threw their knives into the nearby bushes to avoid police detection. One of the knives was later recovered: a picture of this knife is at Annex A. This knife was 47.5 cm long with a 35 cm-long blade.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 14 November 2021 at about 9.32 pm, the complainant called the police reporting the above. From about 9.32 pm to about 9.40 pm, the police received 7 other calls about this incident.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Accused and the co-accused then left the location in another private-hire car for Blk 180 Bishan St 13, Singapore, where they asked the first involved party to meet them in a van. When they arrived, to avoid detection, they changed into some clothes they found in his van and pried open their GPS tags (the subject matter of TIC charge DAC-910380-2022). They also asked the first involved party to drive them to the Accused’s registered address at Yishun, where the Accused left their GPS tags as well as the clothes they were wearing during the attack while the co-accused remained in the van. After the Accused returned, the Accused and the co-accused eventually moved to the second involved party’s residence, where they met him and the third involved party (the subject matter of the TIC charge DAC-910382-2022). The Accused asked the third involved party to book a hotel room for him and the co-accused in Sentosa where they intended to hide from the authorities, since the Accused thought that the police would not patrol Sentosa; the third involved party did so and assisted them to check in, and thereafter he left. The Accused and the co-accused were subsequently arrested on 15 November 2021 at about 5.40 p</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 14 November 2021 at about 9.56 pm, the victim, who was conveyed to hospital in an ambulance, was medically examined at the Singapore General Hospital where he was found to have suffered:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    Multiple complex lacerations over his scalp, with six deep lacerations (deepest extending down to periosteum), ranging in length from 8 to 14 cm;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    Left upper back V-shaped laceration, approximately 7 cm, extending down to trapezius muscle;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.    Left upper back laceration, approximately 15 cm, with unicortical break in scapula spine;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">d.    Right flank laceration, approximately 15 cm, breaching latissimus dorsi fascia; e.

Left little finger flexor digitorum profundus (“FDP”) tendon rupture,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">for which he underwent multiple wound explorations, haemostasis and primary closure (suture) of the above lacerations, and a left knee wound exploration, debridement, arthrotomy and washout on 15 November 2021. He further underwent a left little finger FDP tendon debridement and insertion of silastic rod on 25 November 2021. He was admitted from 14 to 19 November 2021 and was given 25 days of hospitalisation leave from 14 November 2021 to 8 December 2021 inclusive. These are set out in the medical report at Annex B.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 326 read with section 34 of the PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Accused stands charged for the above offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Antecedents </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       The Accused is traced.

Theophileous underwent Release-On-Supervision (ROS) twice, once in September 2020 for one month and again, in May 2021 for six months.

His mother’s account suggested that the parents were not actively involved in parenting him during his developing years as they were either occupied with work (e.g. mother worked as security supervisor at night) or facing family issues (e.g. frequent arguments between parents). This resulted in limited control over his behaviours since primary school. For example, Theophileous was not at home most of the time and did not inform his mother of his whereabouts. Theophileous also reported having a distant relationship with his father as there was minimal communication and that he was often hit by his father when he misbehaved. Given this, Theophileous’s mother placed him under the care of his maternal auntie, whom he lived with most of the time. It was noted that Theophileous also witnessed his mother being hit by his father when he was young. According to Theophileous and his mother’s account, his mother and auntie consistently provided him with support since young. For example, his auntie would check in with him regularly and when he shared his issues (e.g. studies, work), they provided him with advice and reminders to stay offence-free. Theophileous also spent time with his mother where he accompanied her to church every Sunday or have meals together. Theophileous reported being close to his two brothers.

Following his admission to SBH, Theophileous showed progress in his studies where his grades improved (e.g. his science grade improved from “U” to “C”). He attributed this change to wanting to complete his studies for a better future. While Theophileous continued with his academic studies when serving his RT sentence, his studies were ceased due to institutional offences. It was noted that Theophileous has plans to continue with his studies. On the work front, both Theophileous and his Reporting Officer’s account suggested that there was a lack of motivation to keep himself employed during his ROS from May 2021 to November 2021. For example, Theophileous changed multiples job, citing reasons such as unable to cope with working hours and was given a letter of advice for failure to report to work, leading to his termination.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Companions</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Based on available sources of information, Theophileous’s peer circles appeared to be negative.

Theophileous also started to be involved in fights when he was in the company of his peers. It was noted that his commission of past offences (e.g. robbery when armed, voluntarily causing hurt etc) coincided with the period he associated with them. Despite this, Theophileous continued to spend time with them as he enjoyed their companionship. Theophileous reported a shift during his ROS in May 2021 where he made attempts to minimise contact with most of his negative peers as he recognised that his association with them was not helpful in staying offence free. Despite this, he continued to keep close contact with a few peers from the same group as they supported him financially when he needed help. However, his association with them appeared to lead to the commission of his current offences.

According to him, he consumed alcohol once every few days while in the company of his negative peers and experimented with drugs (e.g. Ice). It was noted that he stopped after one month as he disliked its side effects.

Theophileous’s narrative suggested an escalation in his violent behaviours after being acquainted with his negative peers. For example, he said was involved in fights with his schoolmates during primary and secondary school when provoked, which was corroborated against the school report. Subsequently, he started to use weapons in fights. For example, he was charged for robbery with arms in 2018 and currently faces a charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt.

It appeared that Theophileous’s offences committed in September and November 2021 were also associated with the influences from his negative peers. According to Theophileous, he committed the offences in November 2021 as he was pressurized by the co-accused to “settle the problem”. Although Theophileous was aware that he would be outnumbered by the victim’s peers, he continued with the plan and initiated bringing weapons for self-defense as his thoughts then were “Just go only”, “Not Scared”. When engaged in the act of violence, Theophileous became angered and continued to injure the victim as he wanted to make sure that “the fight was a good one and the victim fall onto the ground”. Following which, Theophileous went on the run and to avoid being apprehended, committed his current offences of mischief (i.e. pried open his tag) and failure to report for his individual session. As for his abetment offence committed in September 2021, Theophileous said he was influenced by his negative peer to earn fast cash as he wanted to have more money for his savings. Theophileous’s narrative indicated progress towards a conventional lifestyle since 2021 as he was “tired” of his current lifestyle. For example, Theophileous made attempts to minimise contact with his negative peers as he recognised that the current lifestyle was not helpful for him to stay offence free and has plans of continuing with his studies.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Part VII – Recommendation</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="middle"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Theophileous Jebaraj presented with multiple needs which require intervention, namely in the areas of his poor emotion regulation and coping, employment, association with negative peers, unconstructive use of leisure time and attitudes towards violence. </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">If sentenced to Reformative Training, Theophileous Jebaraj is recommended to undergo: </p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-2" style="display: inline-block; overflow: auto">√ Level 1 intensity of rehabilitation</p> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-2" style="display: inline-block; overflow: auto">√ Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       The Prosecution submitted for global sentence of 3 years and 11 months to 4 years and 5 months’ imprisonment with 2 to 3 strokes of the cane<b>.</b></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       After suitability report for Reformative Training was called for which recommended reformative training, the Prosecution submitted that on the facts of this case, a second Reformative Training order is not suitable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       The prosecution argued that a sentence of Reformative Training (RT) is not appropriate because the goals of deterrence and retribution are more important than rehabilitation for the Accused at this time.

The two-stage framework outlined in <em>Al-Ansari</em> reaffirmed by a five-judge panel of the Court of Appeal in <b><em>Public Prosecutor v ASR</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23195-SSP.xml')">[2019] 1 SLR 941</a> ("ASR") and <b><em>See Li Quan Mendel v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24968-SSP.xml')">[2020] 2 SLR 630</a>, is therefore clearly the applicable legal framework in this context. The court must first determine whether rehabilitation is the primary consideration and if so, it should then consider the most effective way to achieve this goal. Applying the first stage of the Al-Ansari framework, I determined that the usual focus on rehabilitation was not applicable in this case because the offences committed were serious and were made more severe by the use of violence and an offensive weapon by the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     In <b><em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> ("<em>Boaz Koh</em>"), the High Court listed the circumstances that tend to move away from the usual focus on rehabilitation in the case of young offenders. These include situations where (a) the offence is serious, (b) the harm caused is severe, (c) the offender is resistant to change, or (d) the conditions do not allow for rehabilitative sentencing options to be effective. The Court of Appeal in <em>ASR</em> explained that factor (d) should be considered at the second stage of the analysis, as part of the examination of whether and how rehabilitative options can be implemented.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     However, considering the first three factors, it was clear that the Accused falls into the category of young offenders for whom the usual emphasis on rehabilitation has been displaced. The the voluntarily causing grievous hurt (“<em>VCGH</em>”) Offence alone fulfilled the factors of gravity and harm, tending to move away from the usual focus on rehabilitation. It is worth mentioning that the Accused used a long knife with serrated edge to commit the VCGH offence. He was also convicted for being a member of an unlawful society under the Societies Act (“<em>SA</em>”) and breach of the Computer Misuse Act (“<em>CMA</em>”). I will deal with each of the above factors below.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Serious Offences Committed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     The VCGH Offence is particularly serious because it carries a potential punishment of up to 15 years in prison, caning, a fine, or any combination of these. As discussed by the learned CJ in <b><em>Boaz Koh</em></b> [at 34], <em>“…at the first stage of the sentencing inquiry for youthful offenders, the court is concerned with a threshold question which is whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix. As I have noted above, it may be found not to be so on account of one or more of such factors as the harm caused, the gravity of the offence, the background of the offender and the conditions essential to render rehabilitative options viable”</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     In the case of <b><em>Boaz Koh</em></b>, the appeal for RT was rejected in part due to the "<em>gravity of the offences</em>," which involved charges under sections 324 and 506 of the PC, punishable by up to 7 years in prison or a fine or caning or any combination of these. In this case, the <em>VCGH</em> Offence involves an even more serious charge under s 326 read with s 34 of the PC. The <em>SA</em> Offence is also serious, carrying a potential punishment of up to 3 years in prison or a fine of up to $5,000. Similarly, the <em>CMA</em> Offence is serious crime that can result in prison sentence of up to 3 years or a fine of up to $10,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">A high degree of harm caused</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     The victim of the VCGH Offence sustained a number of serious injuries, including at least 6 deep lacerations on the scalp, 3 lacerations on the back and flank, 1 laceration on the knee, and 1 laceration on the right hand (for a total of at least 11 lacerations). One of the victim's fingers also suffered a tendon rupture. These injuries resulted in a break in the victim's scapula spine and an open fracture in the knee joint. The victim underwent surgery and received 25 days of hospitalisation leave. In addition to the harm inflicted on the victim, the violent and unlawful nature of the attack also disrupted public peace and caused widespread concern among the public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     The SA Offence involved being a member of the “<em>Ang Soon Tong</em>” unlawful society. Organisations such as these are harmful to public peace and safety have no place in our society. Therefore, being a member of an illegal society is detrimental to the larger community of law-abiding citizens.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     The Accused's actions in committing the CMA offence compromised the integrity of the SingPass system, which is trusted by millions of residents to secure almost all their personal information. The unauthorised disclosure of such access codes allows third parties to easily assume one's identity, including opening bank accounts, and this can harm the integrity of Singapore's economic infrastructure. Given the harm that such offences can cause, the Courts in line with Parliamentary intention, have imposed severe sentences to deter such crimes, particularly in light of the current increase in scam cases at the time the offence was committed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     The Accused at this young age already has an illustrious record as a hardened and recalcitrant criminal. He began his criminal career in 2017 at the age of 14, and his first series of offences included violent offences (under section 323 of the PC), sexual offences (section 354(1) of the PC), and property offences (section 379 of the PC). He was sentenced to probation but failed to take advantage of this opportunity for rehabilitation. Instead, his offences escalated, and two years later he committed armed robbery by night (under section 392 read with section 397 of the PC). In this offence, the Accused and his accomplice chose to rob sex workers because they believed it would be "safer." They entered a unit where the victims were renting under the pretext of purchasing sexual services, then brandished knives and demanded money. Despite the severity of this offence, the Accused was again given the chance to reform by rehabilitation through RT for a minimum of 12 months. Now, two years after that offence, he has reoffended with the VCGH offence and other serious offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     The Accused's obstinate refusal to change his criminal behaviour is evident in his repeated offences after being released from rehabilitative institutions. For example, he committed his robbery offence while on probation and away from the Boys' Home on time leave, which he abused to commit the offence. Additionally, his lack of respect for authority is demonstrated by the manner in which he committed the current VCGH offence. While he was released on supervision from RT, he committed the VCGH offence, failed to attend the Selarang Park Community Supervision Centre as ordered, and further committed mischief by tampering with an electronic monitoring tag to avoid being apprehended<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether conditions exist to make RT viable</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     The likelihood of RT being successful in achieving its rehabilitative goals is dependent on the offender's rehabilitative potential: <b><em>Muhammad Zuhairie Adely bin Zulkifli v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19344-SSP.xml')">[2016] 4 SLR 697</a> at [30]. If the offender's rehabilitative potential is low, RT would not be a viable option. The recognition by Parliament that rehabilitation is self-directed and cannot be forced upon unwilling or unable offenders indicates that attempting to rehabilitate an offender through RT would not be appropriate if they have low rehabilitative potential. I fully agree with the submissions of the learned DPP that this is the case for the Accused, as demonstrated by the following factors (including those in <b><em>A Karthik v PP</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a> at [66]):</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>(a) Lack of familial control and positive social influence</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The Accused's parents did not actively participate in parenting and had limited control over his behaviour from a young age. His two brothers, when not incarcerated, were part of negative social groups with the Accused. Although the Accused and his mother claim that his mother and aunt provide support, it is unclear how effective this support is in terms of helping him stay crime-free. Despite their advice and reminders, the Accused's history shows that they have not been effective. In addition to his family, the Accused lacks any positive social influences or prosocial peers to turn to for support.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>(b) Exposure to violence from family and peers</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>From a young age, the Accused has been exposed to violence, including witnessing his father physically assaulting his mother and experiencing fights in his neighbourhood. He surrounds himself with negative peers who introduced him to drugs, alcohol, and fighting, and actively sought to adopt their lifestyle, which he refers to as "thugs of life." Despite being aware of the illegal nature of his actions, he continued to maintain close relationships with some of these peers for financial support.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>(c) Tendency towards violence</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>Since an early age, the Accused has engaged in violent behaviour, starting with unarmed fighting in school and eventually using weapons. He is prone to violence as a means of appearing powerful and does not consider the consequences or harm he may cause when planning acts of violence. In committing the VCGH offence, he continued to attack the victim, who was already on the ground and defenceless, out of anger and a desire to make the fight more enjoyable.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>(d) Previous interventions have failed to rehabilitate the Accused</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The Accused's history of offending has shown that multiple interventions have been unsuccessful in rehabilitating him, and his behaviour has actually escalated.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>(e) Lack of remorse</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The Accused has not expressed remorse for his actions and his behaviour after committing the VCGH offences does not suggest remorse. There is also no indication of remorse or acknowledgement of wrongdoing in his pre-sentencing report</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>(f) Lack of motivation to change</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The Accused has shown a lack of motivation to change, as evidenced by his poor academic performance and misconduct in secondary school, where he was publicly caned, as well as his inability to maintain employment due to a lack of motivation and difficulty coping with working hours. While he has expressed an intention to continue his studies, no concrete plans or details have been provided. The only progress he has made in his studies was while in an institutional setting, and even that progress was short-lived due to institutional offences. This lack of engagement in both studies and work suggests a lack of motivation to change.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     The prosecution argued that the Accused needs to be specifically deterred and that a period of incarceration would be necessary to give him the resolve to change his criminal attitudes. I agree.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     Learned Counsel for the Accused too, rightfully conceded in his submission that in cases where a young offender is convicted of a serious offence, the principle of rehabilitation may be outweighed by other considerations such as the need for general and specific deterrence, as well as retribution. These considerations may be especially relevant in cases involving serious sexual crimes, crimes involving violence, robbery, rioting, and drug offences, particularly those involving drug trafficking and cited the cases of <b><em>PP v Mohamed Noh Hafiz bin Osman</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 4 SLR(R) 0281.xml')">[2003] 4 SLR(R) 281</a> and <b><em>PP v Mohamed Noh Hafiz bin Osman</em></b> [2003] as examples of such cases.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     In his submission learned Defence Counsel stated that the assessment of the Accused's suitability for rehabilitation training (RT) was based on several characteristics that suggest his ability to be rehabilitated during the RT process. He further submitted that the RT report identified a number of areas in which the Accused requires intervention, including his poor emotion regulation and coping skills, employment issues, association with negative peers, constructive use of leisure time, and attitudes towards violence being reasons why the Report recommended that the Accused undergo level 2 intensity RT. He suggested that therefore by undergoing level 2 intensity, the Accused will benefit from the programs catered to address the issues that he presents as opposed to “bundling him to Prison”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     Although learned Defence Counsel argued that the Accused wants to change his ways by focusing on education and avoiding negative influences, I however found no shred of evidence to support this claim on the facts. In particular, the Accused has not taken any action to improve his situation or made any concrete plans to do so. He has not been actively engaged in studies or work. Further, counsel concedes that the Accused has previously failed to take advantage of opportunities for rehabilitation and returning to a law-abiding lifestyle. I find that even at present the Accused only has friends who are negative influences and does not have any prosocial peers for support. It is unlikely that he will be able to avoid these negative influences, as they are the only peers he has. A second RT stint is very unlikely to yield any positive outcome in light of these facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     The Defence also argued that a second RT sentence would be effective in addressing the factors that contribute to the Accused's criminal behaviour because the Accused's family, specifically his mother and aunt, can exert control over him and that there were criminogenic issues that were not addressed during the Accused's previous RT sentence. I find that the argument that the Accused's family has control over him to be unsupported on the facts. The Accused does not always live with his aunt and has continued to commit crimes despite her and his mother's attempts to prevent it. His parents have had "limited control over his behaviours since primary school," and he has a distant relationship with his father<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     Additionally, the learned Defence Counsel did not adequately appreciate the Accused's history of violence. He had already been sentenced to RT for a violent crime, armed robbery by night, but did not complete the sentence due to absconding. In light of this I am unable to agree with the Defence that a second RT term would be successful in addressing this issue when the previous RT term was not.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     Counsel urged the court to place weight on the letter from the Accused submitted to the court on 29 November 2022. I found the Accused's expression of remorse in the letter to be insincere and motivated by tactical considerations. The letter was only submitted during the sentencing proceedings, more than a year after the offences were committed. It did not show any genuine remorse or recognition of the harm caused to the victims and society, nor did it acknowledge the errors of his past actions. Besides the Accused's desire to pursue education, which can be pursued in prison school, there was no evidence or concrete plans indicating that he is motivated to change. His claimed disassociation from criminal associates and friends is likely a result of being in custody, rather than a conscious choice.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reliance on unreported RT cases without grounds of decision</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     The Defence Counsel cited several unreported State Courts cases as precedents which included SC-904286-2021 <em>PP v Alester Ang Zhengjie</em> (“<em>Alester Ang</em>”), SC-903315-2020 <em>PP v Noor Najat bin Alwi</em> (“<em>Noor Najat</em>”), and SC-900387-2017 and SC-903399-2022 <em>PP v Mohamed Safit Hasan Bin Mohamed Ayub</em> (“<em>Mohamed Safit</em>”) to argue that the Accused should be sentenced to RT despite having re-offended while released on supervision.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     It is trite law that unreported cases should not be relied upon as precedent in sentencing as cautioned by the learned CJ in <em>Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26478-SSP.xml')">[2021] 4 SLR 1220</a> at [99], <em>“… In any case, absent a reasoned judgment explaining a particular sentencing decision, bare reference to the outcomes in other cases will seldom be useful.”</em></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     This is evident for example, where the Defence Counsel while citing Alester Ang’s case failed to mention that in that case the offence in question was less severe (being punishable by up to 7 years in prison or a fine or caning under section 324 of the PC) and also did not address the specific manner in which it was committed. It is important to note that the offence in the present case caused public concern and was brazen in nature.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     Additionally, Alester Ang had a different criminal history than the Accused in the current case. The most serious offence the accused in the previous case was convicted of (rioting) carries a maximum punishment of 7 years in prison, while the Accused in the current case had past convictions for offences of armed robbery by night (under sections 392, 397 read with 34 of the PC) which carried a sentence of 2 to 10 years in prison and 12 strokes of the cane. Alester Ang also made efforts to disassociate himself from his gang and reduce contact with criminal peers and spent most of his time during his period of rehabilitation on work and planning for his future business. While he did exhibit a willingness to use some violence in his offence, his overall rehabilitative prospect appeared better than those of the Accused in the current case<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     The Defence also failed to consider several important aspects of the <em>Noor Najat</em> case cited, including the fact that the offences in question were less severe and that <em>Noor Najat</em> also had a different criminal history than the Accused in the current case, having been charged with offences under the Moneylenders Act, the Protection from Harassment Act, affray, and possession of a scheduled weapon under section 7(1)(a) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act. The most serious offence (possession of a scheduled weapon) carries a maximum punishment of 5 years in prison.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     I also found Counsel’s reliance on <em>Mohamed Safit</em> (SC-900387-2017) to be misplaced as the accused in that case was sentenced to imprisonment; and his case in SC-903399-2022 is still pending.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     It is important in each case for the court to consider the specific circumstances when deciding on the applicable principles of sentencing that should be dominant for an appropriate sentence. Rehabilitation may not be the primary goal in every case, and there may be other factors that make reformative training less feasible or effective. Ultimately, the decision on an appropriate sentence should be based on a careful consideration of all relevant factors. After a careful assessment of all the factors, I found that RT is not a suitable sentence in this case because the focus on deterrence and retribution has made rehabilitation less necessary. Additionally, the current conditions as highlighted above do not allow for RT to be a viable option for rehabilitating this accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     I now turn to consider the appropriate sentences for the charges that the Accused has been convicted on.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sentencing Approach</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">DAC-923002-2021: S 326 r/w s 34 PC</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Indicative starting sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     The approach for such offences is clearly articulated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v BDB</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> (“<em>BDB</em>”) at [55]. It involves considering the seriousness of the injury caused by the offence under section 325 PC and arriving at an indicative starting sentence. The starting sentence is then adjusted based on the offender's culpability and any aggravating or mitigating factors that are present. The approach involves three steps:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_1"/>1.     Consider the seriousness of the injury and arrive at an indicative starting sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_2"/>2.     Adjust the starting sentence for culpability.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_3"/>3.     Adjust the starting sentence for any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     Based on the severity of the injuries described above, the prosecution recommended that a starting point of 3 years' imprisonment be considered. On the other hand, the Defence submitted that the starting point sentence should be 18 months’ imprisonment based on two cases.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     The starting point of 18 months' imprisonment for the VCGH offence suggested by the Defence would be clearly erroneous in this case. The Defence cited the cases of <b><em>PP v P Rajenthirun</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21641-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 95</a> <em>("Rajenthirun"</em>) and <b><em>PP v Pettijohn William Samuel</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24051-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 290</a> (<em>"Pettijohn"</em>). In those cases, the starting point was 18 months' imprisonment as the injuries were less severe than in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_i"/>(i)     In <em>Rajenthirun</em>, the victim suffered one laceration each on his forehead, eyebrows, and lip, as well as multiple head fractures, and received 8 days of medical leave. The starting point was 18 to 24 months' imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_ii"/>(ii)     In <em>Pettijohn</em>, the victim suffered mildly displaced fractures around the eye and jaws and a left zygomatic arch fracture on the cheek. The court determined that the starting point was 18 months' imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     In contrast, the victim in this case has sustained far more serious injuries. Therefore, a starting point of 18 months' imprisonment would be inadequate. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the starting point should be 3 years’ imprisonment taking reference from two cases.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     In the case of <b><em>PP v Muhammad Faizal bin Mohamed Salleh</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23227-SSP.xml')">[2019] SGDC 115</a> at [52], the victim suffered multiple wounds, including three 1.5 cm lacerations on the ear, a 1 cm superficial laceration on the back of the left hand, four cuts ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 2 cm on the back of the right hand, a 2 cm deep cut on the right lateral elbow, a 2 cm superficial cut on the right medial elbow, a 3 x 2 cm and 2 cm deep right lateral chest wound, a 1 x 0.5 cm and 0.5 cm deep right anterior axillary wound, a 2 x 1 cm and 4 cm long right posterior axilla wound, five 1 cm-long posterior neck wounds, one 2 cm-long right anterior shoulder wound, and right haemothorax and pneumothorax. As a result of these injuries, the victim was unable to follow her ordinary pursuits for 34 days, 27 of which were due to hospitalisation. The starting point for the sentencing in this case was 4 years' imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     In the case of <b><em>PP v Muhammad Syafiq Bin Mohamed Abbas</em></b> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24469-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGDC 114</a> at [36], the victim sustained a 1.5 to 2 cm laceration on the left lower lateral chest over the 6th to 8th ribs, undisplaced fractures of the lateral aspect of the 6th to 8th ribs, a soft tissue haematoma with air pockets in the left lower chest wall and left lateral abdominal wall/hypochondrium, and a 5 cm laceration of the external intercostal muscle with a large chest wall haematoma. The victim received 17 days of medical/hospitalisation leave for these injuries. The starting point for the sentencing in that case was 3 years and 6 months' imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     In the present case, the victim sustained a total of 11 lacerations, including 6 deep lacerations on his head, which is a vulnerable part of the body. One of these lacerations extended almost down to the bone. The victim also suffered a laceration that caused a break in his scapula (shoulder blade) and another laceration that was so deep that it penetrated the victim's patella (kneecap) and caused an open fracture in the knee joint. I was therefore of the view that a starting point of 3 years’ imprisonment is appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">An uplift for the dangerous means used</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     As a long knife with a serrated edge was used in this case, an uplift of 6 months’ imprisonment is clearly appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Aggravating and mitigating factors as set out at BDB </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     The Prosecution submitted that an uplift of 6 months to 9 months’ imprisonment is appropriate on consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors. The Defence submitted for an uplift of 6 months’ imprisonment. I was of the view that the uplift should be 6 months imprisonment for the following aggravating factors in this case:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_i"/>i.     Brutal and unprovoked group attack:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The accused and the co-accused violently attacked the unarmed victim with knives in a sustained assault that was witnessed by members of the public. The victim was not provoked and did not defend himself or retaliate during the attack, which was marked by extreme ferocity.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>ii. Planning and premeditation:</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The accused and the co-accused planned and agreed to attack the victim with knives beforehand, going as far as purchasing the knives and concealing them to avoid arousing suspicion.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>iii. Concealment of weapons after the attack:</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The accused and the co-accused attempted to dispose of their knives after the attack, which has been considered an aggravating factor in previous cases: <em>PP v Ahirrudin Al-Had bin Haji Arrifin</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27276-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 60</a> at [64] to [65].</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>iv. Concealment of himself after the attack:</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The accused took steps to avoid detection by the police after committing the offence, including changing his clothes, leaving his GPS tag at home and attempting to hide at a hotel.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>v. Antecedents and prior intervention by authorities:</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The accused has a history of violence, including a previous offence involving a knife, and has received probation and juvenile home sentences and RT for hurt offences.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>vi. Public interest considerations:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The offence was committed in a public place in front of a temple and a coffee shop, causing public disquiet as evidenced by the number of calls the police received about the incident.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/> <em>vii. Offending while on supervision:</em> </p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id=""/>The accused committed this offence while under supervision after being released from reformative training, betraying the trust placed in him by the authorities to rehabilitate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     Considering all the above factors I determined that a sentence of 4 years imprisonment and in addition the imposition of 2 strokes of the cane would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">DAC-910381-2022: S 14(3) SA</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     It was submitted by Defence that with regard to the charge of membership in an unlawful society, the accused's role in the society was relatively low. Therefore, a sentence of no more than 4 weeks' imprisonment was sought for the offence. I could not agree. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution the accused served as a "Fighter" for a period of approximately 7 years and 5 months which demonstrates that he was not as inactive in the society as portrayed by the Defence. I therefore imposed a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">DAC-910819-2022: S 8(2) r/w s 10(1) CMA</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     Seeking a sentence of 1 to 2 months’ imprisonment, the learned DPP relied on <b><em>PP v Law Aik Meng</em></b> [2007] SLR(R) 814 (<em>"Law Aik Meng"</em>) at [24(e)] and submitted that the courts will take a strict approach in imposing severe sentences for such offences which affect the delivery of financial services and/or the integrity of the economic infrastructure. Additionally, he cited the intention of Parliament in enacting the CMA was to <em>"send a deterrent message to all those who plan to misuse or exploit computer technology with criminal intent":</em> Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (28 May 1993), vol 61 at cols 303 to 304 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for Home Affairs).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     The Defence Counsel submitted that given the fact that the Accused obtained SingPass details from his co-accused and established bank accounts that were linked to certain scams, a sentence of 4 weeks' imprisonment is appropriate, with which submission I could not agree.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     On the contrary, I found the submissions by the learned DPP to be apposite to facts of this case. The Singpass system is every Singapore resident's trusted digital identity. The trust placed in this system is critical, as it is the key that millions of residents rely on to secure almost all of their personal information. The inviolability of the Singpass system is especially important for financial transactions, where one can open an account using the "MyInfo" function with just a Singpass. Therefore, the unauthorised disclosure of a Singpass account allows third parties to easily assume the identity of the account holder, including opening bank accounts. These accounts can then be used by scammers to commit fraud and money laundering offences while remaining anonymous. These offences are also extremely difficult to prevent and detect.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     Based on the above factors, I determined that a sentence of 2 months' imprisonment is appropriate to achieve general deterrence. This determination took into account the Accused's instigation of the co-accused to reveal sensitive and confidential Singpass credentials, as well as the significant harm caused by the transfer of large sums of money in and out of accounts opened using the co-accused's credentials and linked to scams.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Calibration of Global Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     I ordered that the sentences for VCGH charge in DAC-923002-2021 and the CMA charge in DAC-910819-2022 should be served consecutively, as they were committed at different times and locations, in the course of different transactions, and they affect different legally-protected interests. The sentence would be a total imprisonment term of 4 years and 2 months’ and 2 strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     However, due to the consecutive sentences being imposed, the sentence for the VCGH charge in DAC-923002-2021, was adjusted downwards in consideration of the principle of totality, considering the Accused's age and the fact that he had never previously served a prison term. As a result, a downward calibration of 12 months was applied. In the result the Accused will serve a term of 3 years and 2 months imprisonment with 2 strokes of the cane. The sentence was backdated to the date of his remand.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Pre-Sentencing Report for Reformative Training at 9.
