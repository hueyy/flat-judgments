citizen, presently aged 54. He faced two proceeded charges, one for theft and another for drug consumption. He also consented to have another two charges, one for drug possession and another for assisting an illegal moneylender, taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. After considering the submissions made by parties, I sentenced the accused to ten years of preventive detention. In this judgment, I explain the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charges</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charges.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>DAC-901273-2022 (“</u> <b><u>1<sup>st</sup> Charge</u></b> <u>”)</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You… are charged that you, on 20 January 2022, at around 11.15am, at [address redacted], did commit theft of one gold chain with an abacus and a fish pendant (with a value of at least $870), which was in the possession of one Teng Soo Hung (“the victim”) and which the victim was wearing, and in committing the said offence you did use criminal force on the said victim, to wit, by grabbing and pulling the chain, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 356 of the Penal Code 1871.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>DAC-905340-2022 (“</u> <b><u>2nd Charge</u></b> <u>”)</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You… are charged that you, on or before 20 January 2022, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, <em>to wit</em>, monoacetylmorphine, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the MDA,</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">and further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 9 March 2000 convicted in State Court No. 24, <em>vide</em> DAC8324/2000, of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, <em>to wit</em>, diamorphine, under s 8(<em>b</em>)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Rev Ed), and sentenced to 5 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall therefore be punished under s 33A(2) of the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       The charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"/>(a)     MAC-905341-2022 – this was a charge for possessing, without authorisation, one packet and one straw containing a total of not less than 8.24g brown granular/powdery substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.15g of diamorphine. This was an offence under section 8(<em>a</em>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (“<b>MDA</b>”) and punishable under section 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"/>(b)     MAC-908707-2022 – this was a charge for assisting an illegal moneylender. The accused handed over an automated teller machine card (“<b>ATM card</b>”), his personal identification number and the iBanking access code to the moneylender for the purpose of allowing the moneylender to use the bank account to facilitate the operation of the moneylending business. This was an offence under section 5(1), and punishable under section 14(1)(<em>b</em>)(i) read with section 14(1A)(<em>a</em>) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       The relevant facts, as presented in the Statement of Facts, are reproduced below. The accused admitted to these facts without qualification.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Facts relating to the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    Investigations revealed that on 20 January 2022, at around 10am, the accused was in the vicinity of Jurong West Street 91. He was in the area looking for something to steal as he had no money and wanted to purchase “heroin” (the street name for diamorphine) as well as to pay off his debts.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    At around 10.15am, the victim was shopping at the market at Blk 966 Jurong West Street 93, Singapore. At around 11am, the accused spotted the victim walking along the street near Blk 966 Jurong West Street 93. He noticed that the victim was wearing a gold chain and carrying a bag and observed that the victim was elderly. He targeted the victim because of her gold chain and her age, and formed the intention of stealing her gold chain.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    The victim began to walk back to the Unit. The accused followed the victim surreptitiously. When the victim reached Blk 975 Jurong West Street 93, she took the elevator up to her Unit. The accused waited downstairs at the lift lobby and saw that the lift had stopped at the 10th floor. The accused then took the next lift to the 10th floor.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    When he reached the 10th floor, he saw the Unit, with its gate closed [but the] door opened, and saw the victim inside the Unit. The accused approached the gate of the Unit and rang the doorbell, while shouting the name, “David.” He did so to get the victim’s attention and to lure her closer to the gate. As the victim approached the gate, the accused kept repeating the name, “David”, and the victim replied that she did not know who that was.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10 At around 11.15am, when the victim was near the gate, the accused suddenly stretched his arms through the rails of the gate and grabbed the gold chain that the victim was wearing around her neck. On the gold chain was an abacus and a fish pendant. The accused pulled on the gold chain, breaking it, and took the gold chain with the abacus and the pendant from the victim’s possession.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    After stealing the said items, the accused proceeded to take a bus to Boon Lay Interchange. He returned to his friend’s block and disposed of his grey shirt at the fifth floor, as he knew that the police would be searching for him with that shirt. He then took a taxi to Jalan Bukit Merah as he was familiar with a pawn shop there. The accused proceeded to the Maxi-Cash at Blk 155 Jalan Bukit Merah, Singapore and pawned the chain with the abacus for $870. He kept the fish pendant in his possession to sell in the future.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    After receiving $870 in cash, the accused proceeded to Bukit Batok by MRT. The accused went to a block at Bukit Batok where he had previously purchased heroin. There, he purchased some heroin and then took a taxi to Boon Lay, where he was arrested.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Facts relating to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    After the accused’s arrest, he was brought to Woodlands Police Divisional HQ for further investigations.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    There, the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and respectively marked “P-SL-22-02073-1 KAMIS BIN BASIR SXXX” and “P-SL-22- 02073-2 KAMIS BIN BASIR SXXX”. The two bottles were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis on 21 January 2022.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    On 6 February 2022, the following two certificates were issued under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (“MDA”) by analysts with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Siti Aisyah Binte Jamil issued a certificate bearing Lab. No. 2201194-AT-001 stating that the urine sample marked “P-SL-22-02073-1 KAMIS BIN BASIR SXXX” was analysed and found to contain monoacetylmorphine.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) Maggie Tiong Su issued a certificate bearing Lab. No. 2201194-AT-002 stating that the urine sample marked “P-SL-22-02073-2 KAMIS BIN BASIR SXXX” was analysed and found to contain monoacetylmorphine.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    Monoacetylmorphine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    The accused admitted that he had last consumed “heroin” (the street name for diamorphine) on the morning of 20 January 2022 at around 9am. He smoked “heroin” in the stairwell of a block near his residence. The accused had placed heroin on the aluminium foil and heated it from below using a lighter, then used a rolled-up piece of paper to inhale the resulting fumes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    Monoacetylmorphine is a known metabolite of diamorphine. The monoacetylmorphine found in the accused’s urine samples (referred to at [16] above) was therefore a result of the accused’s consumption of diamorphine.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    The accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume monoacetylmorphine. He has therefore committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    Furthermore, prior to the commission of the said offence, the accused was on 9 March 2000 convicted in State Court No. 24, vide DAC8324/2000, of s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1998 Rev Ed), and sentenced to 5 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date.

clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Corrective training and preventive detention suitability report</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       The accused pleaded guilty to the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Charges on 28 October 2022. Thereafter, I called for a report to determine the accused’s suitability for corrective training and preventive detention pursuant to section 304(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“<b>CPC</b>”). The report itself comprised of two parts – a medical memorandum and a pre-sentencing report. The medical memorandum certified that the accused was physically and mentally suitable for both corrective training and preventive detention.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       The pre-sentencing report highlighted the accused’s general risk factors as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"/>(a)      <b>Family/marital circumstances.</b> The accused’s account suggested that his family circumstances were not a source of stress for the accused. The accused has been married for 31 years with three adult children and three grandchildren. The accused reported that his wife would “never give up on [him]” and that he had come to “take her for granted”. The accused also reported that he had harmonious relationships with his children and their spouses.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"/>(b)      <b>Employment history.</b> According to the accused, he only worked in two areas whenever he was not incarcerated - food and beverage (“<b>F&amp;B</b>”) services and warehouse settings. Prior to his last release from prison in 2021, the accused was placed on a community-based programme during which he worked in an F&amp;B outlet for about four months. After his release, he worked as a warehouse assistant for three months until he was arrested for his present offences.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"/>(c)      <b>Companions.</b> The accused admitted that his social circle was made up of peers who were negative influences. In particular, the accused had served as a guarantor for one of his friends who obtained a loan from illegal moneylenders. His friend defaulted on the repayments and became uncontactable. This resulted in the moneylenders harassing the accused which, in turn, contributed to the commission of the present offences.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"/>(d)      <b>Drug issues.</b> The accused has a history of drug abuse as shown by the fact that he was detained at a drug rehabilitation centre on three previous occasions and he was sentenced, in 2000, to long-term imprisonment for a period of five years and six months for drug offences. For his current offence of drug consumption, the accused had used heroin to cope with the stress arising from harassment from illegal moneylenders. He recounted that heroin abuse gave him a peace of mind. He had abused heroin for three days before being arrested.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_e"/>(e)      <b>Leisure/recreation activities.</b> The accused’s account revealed that his choice of recreational activities was not an area of concern. The accused liked to spend time with his grandchildren and cook for his family.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_f"/>(f)      <b>Anti-social patterns.</b> The accused’s presented with behavioural patterns associated with anti-social behaviour. For instance, the accused presented with an emphasis on the utility of crime, had a history of breaching the requirements to report for urine tests and had no pro-social friends.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_g"/>(g)      <b>Attitudes/orientation.</b> The accused reported that he committed the offence set out in the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge as he was desperate after being harassed by illegal moneylenders. He also committed the offence in MAC-908707-2022 (an offence for assisting an illegal moneylender) because he needed cash and had not thought of the consequences of handing over his ATM card to the moneylender. In addition, the accused considered his present offences to be less severe than his past offences as he had only committed a “one-time theft” rather than “a series of theft”. Taking these points collectively, the pre-sentencing report opined that the accused placed an emphasis on the utility of crime to resolve immediate problems and minimised the severity of the present offences.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_h"/>(h)      <b>General risk of criminal recidivism.</b> The accused was categorised into the “high risk/need” level of criminal re-offending. He belonged to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_i"/>(i)      <b>Protective factors.</b> The pre-sentencing report indicated that the accused did not present with protective factors.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ submissions</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prosecution’s submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     The Prosecution submitted that the accused should be placed in preventive detention for a term of at least ten years. In this regard, the Prosecution made four points:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"/>(a)     The accused’s antecedents revealed that he had a propensity to re-offend when not serving a sentence and that he had already been through two stints of corrective detention and multiple terms of imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"/>(b)     The circumstances of the present offending also demonstrated a need to protect the public. The accused re-offended in the present case less than six months after he was released from his previous stint of corrective training and he had committed a serious crime in part to feed his drug habit.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"/>(c)     The pre-sentencing report placed the accused in the “high risk/need” level of criminal re-offending and stated that he belonged to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release. The report also highlighted that the accused was willing to commit crimes to manage his immediate problems.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"/>(d)     The fact that the accused had not previously been sentenced to corrective training for the offence of drug consumption did not mean that preventive detention would be inappropriate. The facts revealed that the accused had been through a lengthy term of imprisonment for drug consumption and that he had antecedents for failing to report for urine tests.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     The Prosecution submitted that preventive detention would be more suitable than corrective training in the present case as the length of incarceration would “necessarily be higher than the previous stints of seven and eight years respectively’ and the likely imprisonment sentence in the present case would have been above nine years’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     The Prosecution also took the view that the sentence should not be backdated as the accused had shown no exceptional circumstances why backdating was warranted.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mitigation and Defence’s submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     In mitigation, the Defence submitted that the accused was the sole breadwinner of his family and he had to support both himself and his wife, who suffers from high blood pressure. It was argued that the crime was not premeditated as the accused did not arm himself with a weapon and he had no intention – and did not – cause the victim any serious harm. The Defence also highlighted that the accused pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and cooperated fully with investigations.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     For completeness, I should highlight that Defence also submitted that the accused did <em>not</em> commit the offence of snatch theft in order to feed his drug habit. However, this submission was contrary to paragraph six of the Statement of Facts (to which the accused agreed to without qualification) which stated, in part, that the accused “was in the area looking for something to steal as he had no money <b>and wanted to purchase “heroin”</b> (the street name for diamorphine) <b>as well as pay off his debts</b>” (emphasis added). Hence, there were two reasons for the accused’s offence of snatch theft, one of which was to purchase heroin. I therefore disregarded the submission that the accused did not commit the offence of snatch theft in order to feed his drug habit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     Insofar as sentencing was concerned, the Defence did not object to a sentence of preventive detention or corrective training. However, the Defence submitted that the length of any such incarceration should be seven to eight years. The Defence argued that the accused had accepted full responsibility for his offending behaviour, he was aware that one of the root causes for his present offences was the bad company he kept and there was no escalation in the severity of the accused’s offending. The accused also had the benefit of close family relationships and pro-social recreational activities. Finally, it was submitted that an imprisonment term of ten years would be crushing as the accused would not be able to build up a nest egg for his retirement with his wife.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     The Defence also requested that the accused’s sentence be backdated to the date of his remand, in view of the fact that he had cooperated with the authorities and had pleaded guilty early. This was a request which the accused himself also made before the Court.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     Arising from the submissions of parties, three issues arose for consideration:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"/>(a)     Whether the accused should be sentenced to preventive detention or corrective training.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"/>(b)     The length of time for which the accused should be incarcerated.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"/>(c)     Whether the sentence should be backdated to the accused’s date of remand.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Judgment of the Court</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether preventive detention or corrective training</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     It was not disputed in the present case that the technical requirements for both preventive detention and corrective training under sections 304(2)(<em>a</em>) and 304(1)(<em>a</em>) of the CPC, respectively, were satisfied. Given that, whether the accused should be sentenced to preventive detention or to corrective training turned on whether the paramount sentencing consideration for the present case was the protection of the public: <em>Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19466-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 209</a> (“<b><em>Sim Yeow Kee</em></b>”) (at [107]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on preventive detention and corrective training</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     As may be gleaned from the relevant statutory provisions, the substantive requirements for the regimes of corrective training and preventive detention are different. Under section 304(1) of the CPC, the twin considerations of reformation and prevention undergird a sentence of corrective training:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Section 304(1), CPC</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">304.—(1)    Where a person of 18 years of age or above —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    is convicted before the General Division of the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least twice since he or she reached 16 years of age for offences punishable with such a sentence; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, <b>if the court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to the person’s reformation and the prevention of crime</b> that the person should receive training of a corrective character for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiry of his or her sentence, the court, unless it has special reasons for not doing so, must sentence him or her to corrective training for a period of 5 to 14 years in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, or any sentence of imprisonment and fine.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added.]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     Reformation (or rehabilitation) and prevention are two of the four classical principles of sentencing: <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0814.xml')">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814</a> (at [17]). Reformation or rehabilitation aims to discourage the commission of future offences by the offender by seeking to alter the values of the offender: <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a> (at [30]). The focus in this regard is on the perceived needs of the offender. Prevention, on the other hand, takes a more public interest slant. This principle focuses on ensuring, as far as reasonably practicable, that the crime is not repeated.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     Given that rehabilitation and prevention comprise part of the classical principles of sentencing, the operation of such considerations may also justify the imposition of a term of regular imprisonment. Hence, where a choice is to be had between regular imprisonment and corrective training, the decision depends on the relative effectiveness of corrective training and regular imprisonment, having regard to the interests of the offender’s reformation, crime prevention and the need for specific deterrence: <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> (at [104]). Generally, given the lack of a qualitative difference between corrective detention and regular imprisonment, corrective training may be more appropriate where a longer term of incarceration than the likely term of regular imprisonment would serve the stated interests: <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> (at [103]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     In contrast, preventive detention is premised on a wholly different penological basis. This is provided for under section 304(2) of the CPC:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <u>Section 304(2), CPC</u> </p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Where a person 30 years of age or above —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    is convicted before the General Division of the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least 3 times since he or she reached 16 years of age for offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least 2 of those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training; or</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    …</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, <b>if the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public</b> that the person should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiry of his or her sentence, the court, unless it has special reasons for not doing so, must sentence him or her to preventive detention for a period of 7 to 20 years in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, or any sentence of imprisonment and fine.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added.]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     The principles relating to preventive detention may be summarised as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"/>(a)     The “overarching principle” and “overwhelming consideration”, as set out in section 304(2) of the CPC, is the need to protect the public: <em>Public Prosecutor v Rosli bin Yassin</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGCA 0021.xml')">[2013] SGCA 21</a> (“<b><em>Rosli</em></b>”) (at [11]) and <em>Public Prosecutor v Raffi Bin Jelan and Another</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30011-M.xml')">[2004] SGHC 120</a> (“<b><em>Raffi</em></b>”) (at [24]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"/>(b)     Because of the primacy of this principle, all other sentencing issues and considerations take reference from the need to protect the public. This is not to say that the individual situation of the offender should be disregarded altogether; however, considerations of proportionality would not apply rigorously: <em>Sim Yeow Kee</em> (at [97]) and <em>Kuah Teck Hin v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27520-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 119</a> (“<b><em>Kuah Teck Hin</em></b>”) (at [21]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"/>(c)     The meaning of the phrase “protection of the public” is not limited to protection from physical bodily harm. Hence, preventive detention may be imposed even in cases where the offence in question does not involve violent crime. Indeed, “the real test is whether or not the degree of propensity towards <em>any</em> type of criminal activity at all is such that the offender ought to be taken out of circulation altogether”: <em>Tan Ngin Hai v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 2 SLR(R) 0152.xml')">[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152</a> (at [8]) (emphasis added).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"/>(d)     In considering the overarching principle of protecting the public, the courts have had regard to the following factors which relate to the past, present and future:</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_23-p2_d-p3_i"/>(i)       The offender’s history of criminal behaviour: <em>Public Prosecutor v Perumal s/o Suppiah</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4146-M.xml')">[2000] SGHC 103</a> (“<b><em>Perumal</em></b>”) (at [15]).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_23-p2_d-p3_ii"/>(ii)       Circumstances of the offender’s present offending: <em>Perumal</em> (at [19]-[20]).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_23-p2_d-p3_iii"/>(iii)       Risk of future re-offending. This may, in turn, be gleaned from the pre-sentencing report, the presence or lack of remorse, and the presence or lack of risk and protective factors: <em>Rosli</em> (at [25]–[29]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"/>(e)     If the court comes to a view that it is necessary to protect the public by sentencing the offender to a substantial period of incarceration, the offender <em>must</em> be sentenced to preventive detention unless there are special reasons for not doing so. Any “special reason” must be exceptional and would generally relate to the offender’s physical and mental suitability for the regime: <em>Perumal</em> (at [41]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Need to protect the public</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     In the present case, it was plain to me that there is a real need to protect the public against future re-offending by the accused such that a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed. In arriving at this conclusion, I considered the accused’s history of offending, the circumstances of the present offences and the risk of future re-offending.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     To start with, the tapestry of offending the accused has weaved over more than two decades revealed three highly disturbing patterns. First, the accused struggled with committing drug and property-related offences. As regards property-related offences, the accused’s antecedents begun in 1990. Since then, he has committed numerous instances of theft and robbery. The accused has been convicted of ten counts of either theft or robbery since 1990, including the conviction for the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge. In relation to his past sentences, there were also many other similar charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. As regards drug offences, the accused has been convicted of five counts of drug-related charges since 1996 (including the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge). Apart from court convictions, the accused had also been sent to a drug rehabilitation centre on three separate occasions and placed on drug supervision regimes in multiple other instances. The accused’s history of offending disclosed that he was a habitual offender where drug and property-related crimes were concerned.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     Second, the accused has been, since 2000, unable to refrain from crime for any substantial period whenever he was released from incarceration and re-integrated into society. In 2000, the accused was sentenced to an aggregate of six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for drug offences. He must have been released early because in 2005, less than six years later, he was again convicted in court. This time, his aggregate sentence was seven years’ corrective training and 18 strokes of the cane. Shortly after the expiry of the seven-year period, the accused was, in 2013, again sentenced to eight years corrective training for theft offences. I was given to understand that the accused was released on 31 July 2021 after serving that sentence. Even so, he re-offended less than six months later, on 20 January 2022. In short, the accused has a propensity to resort to criminality when re-integrated into society.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     Third, all of the earlier punishments imposed on the accused have had limited rehabilitative or deterrent effect. The length of his incarceration has gradually increased from one day (in 1990), to six months (in 1993), to seven months (in 1996), to six years (in 2000)), to seven years (in 2005), and, finally, to eight years (in 2013). The last two periods of incarceration were under the corrective training regime. In addition, the accused also suffered multiple strokes of the cane at various points. None of these punishments were sufficient to deter the accused from committing the index offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     Taken together, these three patterns disclosed by the accused’s history of offending – that the accused was a habitual offender, that he was unable to stay crime-free for any significant period and that he was not deterred by his earlier punishments – suggested that there was a need to protect the public from any re-offending by the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     The circumstances of the accused’s present offending reinforced this view. As may be observed, the types of offences committed by the accused in the present instance were entirely consistent with his history. He committed offences relating theft, drugs and illegal moneylending. Significantly, the circumstances in which he committed the offence set out in the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge were not trivial in the slightest. The Statement of Facts disclosed the following.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"/>(a)     The offence of theft was not committed on the spur of the moment. The accused had set out to steal in order to repay his debts and fund the purchase of heroin. In this regard, I did not accept the Defence’s submission that the crime was not premeditated. The Defence made this submission on the basis of the observation that the accused was unarmed. In my judgment, the Statement of Facts revealed that the accused was committed to criminality and the fact that he was unarmed did not change this position.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"/>(b)     The accused intentionally targeted a vulnerable victim. The victim was chosen not just because she was wearing a gold chain but also because she was elderly.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"/>(c)     The accused had no qualms attacking the victim even when she was in her own home where she could rightfully expect peace and safety. This showed a concerning level of brazenness.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"/>(d)     Apart from using deception to commit the crime, the accused also used force. He stretched his arms through the rails of the gate separating the victim from the accused to grab the gold chain whilst the victim was wearing it around her neck. Fortunately, no injury was sustained in the present instance. Nevertheless, in my judgment, the present offence was but a short step from greater violence and serious injury: see <em>Kuah Teck Hin</em> (at [24]) where the offender also targeted vulnerable elderly women and snatched jewellery from their necks.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_e"/>(e)     The accused took steps to evade arrest by disposing of his shirt at a friend’s residential block. In light of this, the Defence’s submission that the accused was remorseful and repentant must be viewed with some circumspection.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     I turn now to address the accused’s future prospects of re-offending. As may already be surmised, both the past and the present suggested that a substantial period of incarceration was necessary to protect the public. The pre-sentencing report and the presence of several risk factors buttressed this view.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     The pre-sentencing report categorised the accused as being in the “high risk/need” level of criminal re-offending. It was opined that the accused belonged to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release. Such a probability must be viewed as relatively high. In <em>Rosli</em>, the offender was sentenced to 20 years’ preventive detention in circumstances where his probability of recidivism was 49% to 60%.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     This was not merely a matter of statistics. The accused’s probability of recidivism was arrived at in light of various risk factors which were highlighted in the pre-sentencing report. First, as conceded by the accused himself, the accused’s social circle consisted of peers who were negative influences. In fact, the present offences were partly committed as a result of the actions of one of these peers who failed to repay an illegal moneylender and became uncontactable. As a result, the accused, as the guarantor, had to bear the burden of repaying the illegal moneylender. Second, the accused’s history of drug abuse may also lead him to commit property offences in order to feed his habit, as was the case for the present offences. Third, the accused’s behaviour and thinking patterns suggested that he viewed crime as a useful way to resolve immediate problems. While the accused was capable of introspection and self-reflection, he was unable to resist the initial temptation of using crime to problem-solve. He also minimised the seriousness of his offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     For completeness, the Defence pointed out that the pre-sentencing report highlighted that the accused’s family environment was stable and was “not a source of stress”. The report also stated that the accused’s choice of recreational activities “was not an area of concern”. For these reasons, the Defence took issue with the report’s conclusion that the accused did not present with protective factors. In my judgment, it was one thing to consider that a certain factor did not present issues and quite another to say that the same factor should be considered “protective”. The fact that the accused’s family and his choice of recreational activities were not areas of concern did not also mean, without more, that they would protect him from future re-offending.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     Taking all of the above points together, the picture that emerged was irresistibly one where there was a clear need to protect the public from future re-offending by the accused. Based on his history of criminality, the circumstances of offending and the likelihood of recidivism, there was, in my judgment, a high probability of the accused continuing to commit drug and property-related offences which have the potential to cause harm to innocent members of the public. In my judgment, the accused should be sentenced to a term of preventive detention.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Length of preventive detention</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     The next issue to address is the length of preventive detention. As mentioned earlier, the Defence took the reasonable position in not objecting to a sentence of preventive detention. However, the Defence submitted that the length of any such incarceration should be seven to eight years. In contrast, the Prosecution took the position that the accused should be sentenced to at least ten years’ preventive detention.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     In <em>Ravindran s/o Kumarasamy v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6253-M.xml')">[2002] SGHC 197</a>, the High Court held (at [92]) that “the duration of the term of PD is guided by the extent to which the public requires protection from [the offender].” The focus, then, is on the future – how much time is required to protect the public from the harm of further re-offending. In this regard, the Prosecution’s position was preferable to the Defence for the following reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     In considering the length of time required to keep the accused out of society in order to protect the public, I had regard to all the factors which I discussed earlier. I considered the fact that the accused’s history of offending painted a picture of a habitual offender, that the circumstances of the present offences were serious and aggravating and that the accused presented with risk factors that strongly suggested that he was likely to re-offend if not incarcerated. All of these factors, considered holistically, led me to the conclusion that a substantial period of preventive detention - even ten years - was appropriate in the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     In particular, I rejected the Defence’s position that incarceration of between seven to eight years would suffice. This was so for two reasons. First, I considered the fact the accused had served two previous stints of corrective training of seven and eight years. On each occasion, the accused had re-offended not long after being re-integrated into society. The two previous terms of incarceration did not deter the accused from committing the present offences a mere six months after being released from prison. I had little confidence that another term of incarceration of seven to eight years, as sought by the Defence, would suffice to protect the public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     The next factor that persuaded me that incarceration for seven to eight years would be insufficient has to do with the likely length of imprisonment, had the accused been sentenced to regular imprisonment. In the present case, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the likely length of sentence, had the accused been sentenced to a term of regular imprisonment, would have been around nine years. This would comprise the mandatory seven years’ imprisonment for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge (and an argument may reasonably be made that the sentence for this charge should be higher than the mandatory minimum) and a term of two years’ imprisonment for the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge (bearing in mind the relevant offence-specific and offender-specific factors as well as the principle of escalation). This broadly suggested that the appropriate length of preventive detention should not be less than nine years in any event. In the present case, incarceration for a period longer than the likely imprisonment term that would have been imposed was, in my judgment, justified because preventive detention, as established earlier, operates on a different penological basis. The imposition of a term of imprisonment would generally incorporate the consideration of proportionality. However, such a principle would not apply rigorously where preventive detention was concerned as the overriding consideration must be the need to protect the public: <em>Kuah Teck Hin</em> (at [21]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     In mitigation, the Defence argued that the accused was the sole breadwinner of his family, that he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, that he had cooperated with the authorities and that a sentence of ten years’ preventive detention would cause hardship to his family in that the accused would not be able save up for his wife and his retirements. Given the primacy of the overarching principle of protecting the public, I did not accord great weight to these arguments.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     In the final analysis, I was of the view that it was expedient for the protection of the public that the accused should be sentenced to preventive detention for ten years.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the sentence should be backdated</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     The final issue to consider was whether to backdate the sentence. As with previous issues, the overriding consideration was again what was required to protect the public. In this regard, the High Court in <em>Rosli</em> held (at [20]) that the fact that the accused has spent time in remand:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…would probably operate in favour of the offender only in <em>exceptional</em> cases. Given the overarching principle to protect the public, if, in fact, the offender’s situation is an <em>extremely serious</em> one, then we would think that the court would <em>not</em> consider taking into account the time the offender has spent in remand. We think that this is likely to be the norm rather than the exception simply because, in principle, situations warranting a sentence of preventive detention are likely to be very serious to begin with. [Emphasis in original.]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     In the present case, the Defence argued that the accused’s sentence should be backdated in light of his cooperation with the authorities and his early plea of guilt. As stated earlier, I did not accord great weight to these arguments. In any event, having decided that a sentence of ten years’ preventive detention was necessary for the protection of the public notwithstanding these facts, it would be incongruous for me to, in the same breath, backdate the sentence on the basis of these same facts. The present case was far from an exceptional one where backdating may possibly be justified.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     For all of the above reasons, I sentenced the accused to preventive detention for a term of ten years. The accused is currently serving sentence.</p> </div></content></root> </div> <form name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm" action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap8 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner" > <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
