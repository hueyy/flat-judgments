class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"/>1       The accused, Mr Young Tat Ong, is a Singapore citizen, aged 66. He pleaded guilty to a single charge of engaging in a conspiracy with one Dinh Dai Quang (“<b>Mr Dinh</b>”) to use as genuine counterfeit Singapore currency. In pursuance of that conspiracy, the accused presented three pieces of counterfeit Singapore $10,000 notes which he had received from Mr Dinh to a bank teller working for DBS Bank Limited (“<b>DBS Bank</b>”), with the intention that the monies be deposited into the bank account of Avazcorp Pte Ltd (“<b>Avazcorp</b>”). At all material times, the accused was the sole director and shareholder of Avazcorp. The accused consented to have another charge for possessing two other pieces of counterfeit Singapore $10,000 notes taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The accused considered his crime to be “a small thing” and took the position that he should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In this judgment, I sentence the accused to 11 years of preventive detention and explain why it is necessary to do so.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       The relevant facts, as presented in the Statement of Facts, are reproduced below. The accused admitted to these facts without qualification. In the Statement of Facts, Mr Dinh is referred to as “Tony”.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Investigations revealed that sometime in November 2021, the accused got to know Tony through an online acquaintance. The accused and Tony then began conversing via WhatsApp. Tony represented to the accused that he was a high-ranking government official based in Vietnam who had access to stocks of S$10,000 ‘Portrait” series notes (“<b>S$10,000 notes</b>”) that were kept in a warehouse belonging to the Vietnamese government. Tony had further claimed that the said notes were payments made by the Singapore Government for investments which the Singaporean government had made into Vietnam. Following these communications, Tony requested for the accused’s assistance to convert the S$10,000 notes to other currencies, and to break down these notes into smaller denominations.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    The accused then shared with Tony that he knew means of how to sell the S$10,000 notes to third parties, and how to break them into smaller denominations in Vietnamese Dong or other currencies. Tony then forwarded pictures of the S$10,000 notes to the accused via WhatsApp and offered to pay the accused a commission equivalent to 40% of the face value for each S$10,000 note that the accused could break into smaller denominations. Both parties then entered into an agreement where they would work together to break the notes into smaller denominations, and/ or convert the notes to different currencies.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    At that juncture, the accused had harboured doubts over the authenticity of any of the S$10,000 notes held by Tony. This was because the colour presentation of the pictures of the notes that Tony had sent to him via WhatsApp appeared dull and dissimilar from genuine S$10,000 notes that he had previously encountered. Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that he had doubts over whether any of the notes he was to handle would be genuine, the accused agreed to assist Tony as he wished to receive the high commission fees which Tony had promised him.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    The accused then informed Tony that Tony would be recognized as a new investor in his company, Avazcorp Pte. Ltd., and that he would sponsor the air tickets, transport fees and hotel lodging expenses of Tony in Singapore.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    On 21 March 2022, the accused met Tony at Changi Airport Terminal 1. Upon meeting the accused, Tony handed to him 2 pieces of the S$10,000 notes bearing serial numbers 2AA071224 [and] 2AA071234. The accused noted that the color of these two notes appeared to be dull in comparison to genuine S$10,000 ‘Portrait’ series notes. Nonetheless, he retained possession of both notes and brought the notes back with him to his place of residence.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    The next day, on 22 March 2022 at around 10.30am, the accused proceeded to Hotel Chancellor to meet Tony. The two individuals then proceeded together to the [DBS Bank outlet located at Plaza Singapura], with the intention of banking in the S$10,000 notes into the accused’s corporate account.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    The accused and Tony arrived at the bank outlet at about 11.15am on 22 March 2022. They then encountered the witness, who was working as a bank teller at Counter 4 of the bank outlet at the material time. The accused then informed the witness that he wished to deposit cash amounting to S$31,000 into the corporate account. At this point, Tony was standing in close proximity to the accused.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    Tony then handed the accused three pieces of S$10,000 notes bearing serial numbers 2AA071231, 2AA071232 and 2AA071227. Despite harbouring suspicions that the S$10,000 notes in Tony’s possession were counterfeit, the accused passed these three notes to the witness, along with one separate piece of a S$1,000 ‘Portrait’ series note that belonged to him. The accused also handed the witness a piece of paper bearing the details of his corporate bank account number, and instructed the witness to deposit the total cash sum of S$31,000 into the corporate account.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    The accused did so pursuant to the agreement he had struck up with Tony (as at [7]) to break the notes into smaller denominations, and/ or convert the notes to different currencies.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    Upon receiving the notes from the accused, the witness detected that something was amiss as the texture of the three S$10,000 notes was different from the usual bank notes that she dealt with in the course of her daily work as a bank teller. The witness also noticed a difference in the colour of these S$10,000 ‘Portrait’ series notes as opposed to other genuine S$10,000 notes which she had encountered. However, she verified that the remaining one piece of S$1,000 ‘Portrait’ series note was indeed a genuine note, and deposited a corresponding sum of S$1,000 into the accused’s corporate account.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    With her suspicions roused, the witness then left Counter 4 and passed the three pieces of S$10,000 notes bearing serial numbers 2AA071231, 2AA071232 and 2AA071227 to the Deputy Branch Service Manager of the bank outlet, one ‘Serene’. ‘Serene’ then proceeded to the workstation of her superior, Christine, the Branch Service Manager of the bank outlet and passed the three notes to Christine for her inspection.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    Upon inspection of the notes, Christine noticed that the colour of the notes was unusual as compared to genuine notes of the same denomination. Christine then assessed the genuineness of the S$10,000 notes by referring to DBS bank’s internal guidelines on Singapore currencies and uncovered several discrepancies pertaining to the security features of the S$10,000 notes that indicated that the three notes were not genuine. These discrepancies were as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"> <em>a</em>.    The texture of the three bank notes was not the same as that of a genuine S$10,000 note.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"> <em>b</em>.    The security thread lines on the three bank notes were blue instead of silver.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"> <em>c</em>.    The portrait watermark images of late-President Yusof Ishak were not distinct on the three bank notes.</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"> <em>d</em>.    The serial numbers for the S$10,000 portrait series notes were supposed to be in red, but the ones found on the three notes were in golden brown.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    Suspecting that the accused had presented counterfeit notes to the witness, Christine then made a ‘999” call… to seek police assistance. After lodging the police report, Christine left her workstation and approached the accused to enquire where he had obtained the three S$10,000 notes. The accused responded that the notes had been provided to him by Tony.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.    The accused and Tony were then later arrested at the scene by police officers, after police officers attended to the bank outlet following the police report.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.    During investigations, the accused admitted that he had harboured strong suspicions that the S$10,000 notes that Tony was supposed to provide to him were counterfeit. Because of these suspicions, he had drafted a document titled “Currency Exchange Agreement” for Tony to sign, which stated that if the notes brought in by Tony into Singapore were rejected by the banks as counterfeits, Tony would have to assume legal liability as the rightful owner of the notes. The accused also knew that Tony was to conceal the said notes when passing through the customs checks of Changi Airport when he entered Singapore, to avoid detection of the notes.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.    However, as the accused wished to receive the commission payments from Tony which were promised to be equivalent to 40% of the face value for each S$10,000 note, he nonetheless engaged in a conspiracy with Tony to attempt to bank in the notes, despite his suspicions that the notes were counterfeit.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.    The three S$10,000 notes presented by the accused to the witness and the other two S$10,000 notes handed to him by Tony on 21 March 2022 were seized by the police. The said five pieces of S$10,000 ‘Portrait’ series notes were later confirmed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“<b>MAS</b>”) to be counterfeit notes…</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charge</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       Arising from the above facts, the accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">You… are charged that you, sometime in or before March 2022, in Singapore, did engage with one Dinh Dai Quang, and others unknown, in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely, to use as genuine counterfeit Singapore currency, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, namely on 22 March 2022, at about 11.15am, at the DBS Bank outlet located at 68 Orchard Road, Plaza Singapura, #B1-25, Singapore, you did use as genuine three (3) pieces of counterfeit Singapore $10,000 portrait series currency notes bearing the following serial numbers that you received from Dinh Dai Quang on 22 March 2022:</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    2AA071231;</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    2AA071232; and</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    2AA071227;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">by presenting the said counterfeit notes to one Loo Swee Hong a bank teller of DBS Bank, to deposit into the DBS Bank account XXX of Avazcorp Pte.

class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       The Prosecution submitted that the accused should be sentenced to at least 11 to 12 years’ preventive detention. In support thereof, the Prosecution made three points.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       First, the Prosecution argued that the accused is a recalcitrant offender with a high propensity for re-offending. In this regard, the Prosecution highlighted that the accused’s extensive criminal record which, in the view of the Prosecution, reveals a pattern of repeated, escalating property offences. It was also argued that the accused’s pattern of recalcitrance in committing property-related offences is consistent with the findings of a pre-sentencing report for preventive detention prepared by the Singapore Prison Service. I will turn to the contents of the pre-sentencing report shortly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       Separately, the Prosecution also submitted that a sentence of preventive detention would not be disproportionate to the offences committed. Relying on the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Daniel Wong Mun Meng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21498-SSP.xml')">[2018] SGDC 47</a> (“<b><em>Daniel Wong</em></b>”), the Prosecution argued that if a term of imprisonment were to be imposed, an appropriate sentence would be a significant uplift from three to four years’ imprisonment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     Finally, the Prosecution argued that when determining the duration of preventive detention, the principle of escalation applies. As the accused was last sentenced to ten years’ preventive detention for similar offences, an appropriate uplift would be necessary to achieve an appropriately deterrent sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigation and Defence’s submissions on sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     The accused acted in person. He sought for a “normal” sentence (<em>i.e.</em>, a term of imprisonment rather than preventive detention) to be imposed. There were four main points to his submission. First, he claimed to be a victim and that it was Mr Dinh who was the real perpetrator. Second, the accused considered the offence he committed to be minor; he described it as “a small thing”. Third, the accused argued that he was merely helping Mr Dinh out of the goodness of his heart. Finally, the accused made the point that he is already 66 years old and that another 11 years’ preventive detention would amount to a “death sentence”. If he were given a term of imprisonment rather than preventive detention, the accused promised not to re-offend in future.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Pre-sentencing report</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     On 8 September 2022, I called for a report to assess the accused’s suitability for preventive detention pursuant to section 304(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“<b>CPC</b>”). The report consisted of two parts – a medical memorandum and a pre-sentencing report. The medical memorandum certified that the accused was physically and mentally suitable for preventive detention.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     The pre-sentencing report was prepared by Mr Chua Zhiren (“<b>Mr Chua</b>”), a Lead Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist with the Singapore Prison Service. In preparing his report, Mr Chua had the benefit of an interview with the accused. In the pre-sentencing report, Mr Chua made the following points.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"/>(a)      <b>Presentation and behaviour during interview.</b> The accused declined to answer some questions regarding his family, employment and current offences, despite reminders for his cooperation and honesty during the interview process. The accused repeatedly claimed that he was a victim as regards the charges which he faced. He also asserted a version of events which differed from that set out in the Statement of Facts. For instance, the Statement of Facts stated that the accused had presented the counterfeit $10,000 notes to DBS pursuant to an agreement with Mr Dinh to break down the notes into smaller denominations or convert them to different currencies. However, to Mr Chua, the accused claimed that he presented the counterfeit notes because Mr Dinh wished to purchase products from his company but was only able to make payment in cash terms. The accused requested that Mr Chua report that the accused wanted an “honest living” and the accused did “no cheating or borrowing or anyhow take money” from others.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"/>(b)      <b>Family/marital circumstances.</b> The accused’s account of his family suggested that he was estranged from his family and had no contact with them since 2008. The accused reported that he was divorced with a daughter and last had contact with his family more than ten years ago. The accused tried to contact his family when he was released from preventive detention in 2018. However, he was unable to as his family had moved and had changed their contact details. The accused also stated that he did not wish to pursue his familial relationships any further.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"/>(c)      <b>Employment history.</b> The accused reported that he has been gainfully employed since he was released from preventive detention in 2018. Initially, he worked as a part-time cleaner before setting up his own company in 2019, dealing in consumer product marketing and sales. The accused declined to go into detail regarding his company and the nature of the business but claimed to work six hours daily managing his company and interacting with his clients.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"/>(d)      <b>Companions.</b> Based on the accused’s account, he associated with prosocial peers who mostly comprised business associates who supported his business. However, he presently had only one friend who was close to him. Even then, the accused reported that he was not close enough to any of his friends to reach out to them for help if he were facing problems.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"/>(e)      <b>Leisure/recreation activities.</b> The accused’s narrative suggested that he was not involved in any prosocial organised activities but was involved in unstructured recreation which was rewarding to him. Such recreation mostly comprised watching television or online videos.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_f"/>(f)      <b>Alcohol/drug issues.</b> Based on the accused’s account, he did not suffer from any alcohol or drug problems.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_g"/>(g)      <b>Antisocial pattern.</b> The accused did not present with any evidence of antisocial personality or behaviour pattern.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_h"/>(h)      <b>Attitudes/orientation.</b> Mr Chua reported that the accused presented with thinking patterns supportive of his offences and rejected the appropriateness of a preventive detention sentence. The accused minimised his role in his current offences by reasoning that he had no ability to ascertain the authenticity of the $10,000 notes. This was so despite his suspicions that the notes were counterfeit. He added that he was merely “helping” Mr Dinh who was his business client. He described his actions in relation to the present offences as “a small thing” which warranted a sentence of between six to nine months’ imprisonment. The accused also appeared to minimise his history of cheating offences when he described them as “failed businesses and investments” and that he had no control over the outcome and he had no intention to cheat his customers.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_i"/>(i)      <b>Protective factors.</b> The accused did not present with any protective factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     Based on Singapore’s norms, Mr Chua assessed the accused as possessing a moderate risk/need level of criminal reoffending. The accused belongs to a group of prisoners with a 30% probability of recidivism within two years of release. According to Mr Chua, the accused’s pro-criminal thinking patterns and absence of significant prosocial support puts the accused at risk of reoffending.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue to be determined</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     The question that arises for determination is whether the accused should be sentenced to a term of preventive detention and, if so, for how long. In determining this issue, I shall first set out the law and general principles relating to preventive detention before applying them to the case at hand.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law relating to preventive detention</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     Under section 304(2)(a) of the CPC, a sentence of preventive detention must be imposed if the following technical and substantive requirements are met:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <b>304.</b>-(2)    Where a person 30 years of age or above –</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    is convicted before the General Division of the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least twice since he or she reached 16 years of age for offences punishable with such a sentence;…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">then, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that the person should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiry of his or her sentence, the court, unless it has special reasons for not doing so, must sentence him or her to preventive detention for a period of 7 to 20 years in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, or any sentence of imprisonment and fine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     For ease of future reference, the necessary technical requirements are extracted as follows.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"/>(a)     The offender is 30 years of age or above.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"/>(b)     The offender is convicted before the General Division of the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"/>(c)     The offender has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least twice since he or she reached 16 years of age for offences punishable with imprisonment for two years or more.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     As regards the substantive criterion, the statutory requirement is that the detention of the offender must be “expedient for the protection of the public”. In understanding what this means, the following principles are relevant.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"/>(a)     The overarching principle is the protection of the public: see <em>Public Prosecutor v Rosli bin Yassin</em> [2013]] SGCA 21 (“<b><em>Rosli</em></b>”) (at [11]). This is to be contrasted with the classical principles of sentencing, being retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. As the High Court held, “[p]reventive detention has a wholly different penological objective”: <em>Public Prosecutor v Raffi Bin Jelan and Another</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30011-M.xml')">[2004] SGHC 120</a> (“<b><em>Raffi</em></b>”) (at [24]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"/>(b)     Flowing from this overarching principle, the other applicable principles in this area have been formulated with public interest as the central point of reference: <em>Rosli</em> (at [11]). This does not mean that the situation of the individual offender is altogether irrelevant but conventional sentencing principles, such as proportionality and the principle that the sentence must fit the crime, would not apply rigorously: <em>Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19466-SSP.xml')">[2016] SGHC 209</a> (at [97]) and <em>Raffi</em> (at [24]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"/>(c)     The scope of protection extends beyond physical harm. Preventive detention is not restricted to offenders with a history of violent behaviour. Offences against property, peace and society in general may also be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether it is appropriate for an order of preventive detention to be made out: <em>Public Prosecutor v Syed Hamid bin A Kadir Alhamid</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7632-M.xml')">[2002] SGCA 40</a> (“<b><em>Syed Hamid</em></b>”) (at [10]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"/>(d)     Factors that may be relevant in assessing whether it is expedient for the protection of the public that an offender be detained under preventive detention include the following.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_d-p3_i"/>(i)       History of criminal behaviour: <em>Public Prosecutor v Perumal s/o Suppiah</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4146-M.xml')">[2000] SGHC 103</a> (“<b><em>Perumal</em></b>”) (at [15]]) and <em>Rosli</em> (at [24]).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_d-p3_ii"/>(ii)       Circumstances surrounding the index offence: <em>Perumal</em> (at [19]) and <em>Raffi</em> (at [29]).</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_d-p3_iii"/>(iii)       Risk of re-offending. This factor may, in turn, be gleaned from the pre-sentencing report (though not conclusive in and of itself), the presence of remorse and the availability of supportive social network and family support: <em>Rosli</em> (at [25]-[29]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_e"/>(e)     If, having regard to the above factors, the court is of the view that it is expedient for the protection of the public that the offender be detained under preventive detention, the court <em>must</em> sentence him or her to preventive detention unless there are “special reasons” for not doing so. Generally, such special reasons refer to the offender’s physical and mental suitability for preventive detention: <em>Perumal</em> (at [41]).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_f"/>(f)     In assessing the period of preventive detention to be imposed, it is the court’s duty to address its mind to the appropriate period of custody merited by the offences for which the offender has been convicted before it and his criminal record. It would only be in exceptional cases that the period of remand is considered in this regard: <em>Rosli</em> (at [20]).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Judgment of the Court</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     Having set out the law and the applicable principles, I now turn to apply them to the facts.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Technical requirements</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     In the present case, the accused did not allege that the technical requirements have not been satisfied. Nevertheless, given that the accused acts in person, I set out briefly how these requirements are satisfied.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"/>(a)     As regards paragraph [17(a)] above, the accused is presently aged 66.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"/>(b)     As regards paragraph [17(b)] above, the accused was convicted on 8 September 2022 before this court of the charge set out in paragraph [3]. The prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years. In addition, the accused shall be liable to a fine.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"/>(c)     As regards paragraph [17(c)] above, the accused has been convicted, since he reached 16 years of age, of the following offences listed at paragraph [6], above, which are punishable with imprisonment for two years or more: S/Nos 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 21.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Substantive requirement</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     I turn now to consider the various factors that bear on whether it is expedient to impose a term of preventive detention. Before doing so, however, it is apposite to re-state the following principle – that the index offence is a property-related offence and not a violence-related offence is no bar to the making of an order for preventive detention. In <em>Tan Ngin Hai v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4249-M.xml')">[2001] SGHC 122</a>, the accused was convicted of theft and was sentenced to eight years’ preventive detention. The High Court dismissed the accused’s appeal against sentence, holding (at [8]) that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">the imposition of preventive detention ought not to be restricted only to persons with a history of violent behaviour as exhibited through the commission of violent crimes. Instead, the real test is whether or not the degree of propensity towards any type of criminal activity at all is such that the offender ought to be taken out of circulation altogether in order that he be not afforded even the slightest opportunity to give sway to his criminal tendencies again.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     The accused in the present case has a long list of antecedents. From the list, the following points may be observed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"/>(a)     The accused is susceptible to committing traffic and property-related offences. However, his traffic offences have ceased since he was disqualified from driving for nine years in 1997. His property-related offences have continued unabated, with the index offence being the latest of such instances.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"/>(b)     The accused has committed property-related offences over four distinct periods.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_b-p3_i"/>(i)       The first period is from 1982 to 1985. During this period, the accused was convicted of property-related offences every year. His sentences became more severe over time with his last sentence during this period being an imprisonment term of 20 months.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_b-p3_ii"/>(ii)       The second period took place more than ten years later in 1996. The accused was convicted of six charges of cheating with another eight charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. These charges related to seeking investors to participate in various bogus schemes such as holiday resort development projects in China and Malaysia and purchasing of franchise rights. The criminal enterprise includes the forging of documents: see <em>Public Prosecutor v Young Tat Ong</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/55437-M.xml')">[2007] SGDC 340</a> (“<b><em>Young Tat Ong</em></b>”) (at [42]). For these offences, the accused was sentenced to preventive detention for a period of 8 years and 6 months.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_b-p3_iii"/>(iii)       After another decade, the accused was charged, in 2007, with 46 charges, including two to which he claimed trial: see <em>Young Tat Ong</em> (at [2]). Again, the accused deceived investors into investing funds into a bogus development project and forged documents were used to further his crimes. For this set of offences, he was ultimately sentenced to ten years of preventive detention in 2008.</p> <p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_22-p2_b-p3_iv"/>(iv)       Finally, approximately four years after being released in 2018, the accused committed the index offence of engaging in a conspiracy with one Mr Dinh to use as genuine counterfeit Singapore currency.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"/>(c)     In between each of these distinct time periods, the accused appears to have managed to stay crime-free for a period. The longest period was for approximately ten years between 1985 and 1996. However, on each occasion, the accused would return back to a life of crime and cheating.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     Overall, it is plain that the accused is a recalcitrant, habitual offender. His cheating and property-related offending started in 1982 and has continued from that point to this year, over four decades later. During that time, the accused has been incarcerated for substantial periods, including two distinct terms of preventive detention. These punishments have had little deterrent or rehabilitative effect. The accused was sentenced to preventive detention of eight and a half years in 1996. That did not deter him from committing the same type of crimes in 2007 for which he was sentenced to 10 years’ preventive detention. That latter period of detention again did not deter him from committing the index offence. On the contrary, the accused’s crimes may have escalated in that the target of his criminal schemes has now extended beyond innocent individuals to large financial institutions, such as DBS Bank. Although the accused did manage to stay crime-free for periods of time, these ultimately proved to be transient and impermanent. For four decades, he has been unable to resist the temptation of profiting from deception and cunning. Based solely on the accused’s history of criminal behaviour, there is a clear pattern of chronic recidivism.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     I note that the present offence was committed in a slightly different way from the accused’s offences in 1996 and 2007. The present offence appears to be relatively more opportunistic and less sophisticated. For his earlier offences, the accused had conceived of bogus property development projects and persuaded unsuspecting victims to invest in them. In the present case, it was Mr Dinh who claimed that he had genuine Singapore currency that he needed to convert to other currencies or break down into smaller denominations. Hence, Mr Dinh could be viewed as the primary instigator with the accused playing a supporting role.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     Nevertheless, the accused’s role was not entirely passive nor was it insignificant. He agreed to assist Mr Dinh to present counterfeit notes to DBS Bank. To this end, the accused offered to pay for Mr Dinh’s travel expenses to Singapore, received Mr Dinh in Singapore and was also the individual, and not Mr Dinh, who presented the notes to DBS Bank. He did all these despite harbouring strong suspicions that the notes provided by Mr Dinh were counterfeit. This is evidenced by the fact that the accused even drafted a document which ostensibly had the effect of assigning all legal liability to Mr Dinh. Nor did the accused perform all of these acts out of the goodwill of his heart, as he claimed before this court. The Statement of Facts establishes that the accused participated in this criminal enterprise in order that he might profit significantly in the form of high commission fees.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     The accused argued, during the course of submissions, that his mistake, in relation to the index offence, was merely to follow Mr Dinh to the bank. I cannot agree. The error in such a view is not so much that it understates the gravity of the offence as it misrepresents the truth altogether. To be clear, this is not simply a case of the accused being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The accused was complicit in and very much part of the conspiracy to use, as genuine, counterfeit notes. He agreed with Mr Dinh to break down the counterfeit notes even though he had doubts over their authenticity. He took real, active steps to further this conspiracy. The present offence is not out of character for the accused. Viewed broadly, the commonality undergirding the accused’s offences in 1996, 2007 and this year is the accused’s willingness to dishonestly profit from deception and cunning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     I turn now to consider the accused’ risk of re-offending in future. In this regard, Mr Chua, in the pre-sentencing report, assessed the accused to have a 30% probability of recidivism within two years. He was described as possessing a moderate risk/need level of criminal reoffending. I note that this level of recidivism is lower than in <em>Rosli</em> (where the accused was assessed to have a 49% to 60% probability of recidivism; at [26]) and <em>Raffi</em> (where the accused was described as falling into the “high risk” category; at [28]). Nevertheless, such a risk of recidivism is still fairly significant and may well justify the imposition of a term of preventive detention. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Iskandar bin Tahar</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20843-SSP.xml')">[2017] SGDC 266</a>, the offender, like in the present case, belonged to a group of offenders with a 30% probability of recidivism within two years of release. At first instance, the accused was sentenced to eight years’ preventive detention and nine strokes of the cane. On appeal, the High Court imposed a sentence of 12 years’ preventive detention and nine strokes of the cane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     Further, the accused demonstrated almost no understanding of the gravity of his offence. Despite the fact that the accused had presented the notes to DBS Bank even though he strongly suspected that they were counterfeit, the accused described himself as a “victim”, both before this court and in his interview with Mr Chua. He minimised his role in the criminal enterprise by asserting that he had no ability to ascertain the authenticity of the counterfeit notes and that he was only “helping” Mr Dinh. At no time did the accused acknowledge the full extent of his culpability. This was not just a situation where the accused lacked remorse, which would have been aggravating enough; he could not even begin to understand why he should be remorseful. Notably, this mindset of rationalisation and minimisation is not limited to the index offence. The accused described his history of cheating as “failed businesses and investments” to Mr Chua and took the position that he had no intention to cheat his customers. Given this, I wholly agree with the opinion stated in the pre-sentencing report that the accused held “thinking patterns supportive of his offences”. This is concerning and troubling in the extreme.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     Finally, there are no external factors that would help the accused realise the folly of his ways. The accused does not have the benefit of a supportive family. He has lost contact with his ex-wife and daughter and does not have any interest in trying to restore his familial relationships. By his own admission, the accused also does not have any friends close enough for him to confide in them if he were facing problems.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     Having regard to the pre-sentencing report, the accused’s inability to appreciate his own responsibility for his offences and his lack of a positive familial and social network, there is, in my judgment, a strong possibility of the accused returning to his previous criminal ways if he were not incarcerated for a significant period.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     In conclusion, I find that it is expedient for the protection of the public that the accused be sentenced to a term of preventive detention. I make this finding on the basis of the accused’s history of criminal behaviour, the circumstances of the present offending as well as the risk of re-offending.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     Taking all the circumstances into account, I agree with the Prosecution that a term of 11 years’ preventive detention would be appropriate. In <em>Daniel Wong</em>, the court recognised that the usual sentencing range for offenders under section 489B of the Penal Code was between three to four years’ imprisonment per charge. Given that the accused here has a lengthy list of antecedents, the large face value of the counterfeit notes in the present case and the presence of the TIC charge, a significant uplift from the three to four years’ imprisonment would be appropriate, if the accused were to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Having regard to the principle that proportionality would not apply rigorously, I am not of the view that 11 years’ preventive detention should be considered wholly disproportionate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     In this regard, I am mindful that the accused is already aged 66. However, three factors persuade me that the sentence should not be reduced on account of his age. First, the accused’s last sentence of 10 years’ preventive detention had no apparent deterrent or rehabilitative effect on the accused. Second, the nature of his crimes means that advanced age would not prove to be a significant barrier to future offending. Finally, it must be recalled that the overarching principle - and paramount concern – in cases such as the present is the protection of the public. Given the accused’s deeply ingrained propensity to cheat and deceive, I find it necessary to protect the public against the danger the accused may pose, even in advanced age.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     The accused submitted that 11 years of preventive detention would amount to a life sentence. I do not agree. In the recent case of <em>Public Prosecutor v BVR</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27846-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGHC 198</a>, the High Court imposed an aggregate sentence of 45 years’ imprisonment on an offender who was 54 years of age at the time of sentencing. The High Court found that the accused would be released around 80 years old and held (at [67]) that “[t]hat would not be effectively imposing a life sentence on [the offender].” In the present case, the accused should be released when he is about 77 years old. Similarly, such a sentence should not be considered a life sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     Accordingly, I sentence the accused to 11 years’ preventive detention.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Sentencing Report for Preventive Detention, page 7.</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>It should be noted that, although the accused was charged with 46 charges, the accused claimed trial to two charges first. He was sentenced to nine years’ preventive detention for these two charges: see <em>Public Prosecutor v Young Tat Ong</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/55437-M.xml')">[2007] SGDC 340</a> (at [1] and [3]). After his appeal against this sentence was withdrawn, he was sentenced to ten years’ preventive detention for other charges, which was to run concurrently with the former sentence.
