The tremie pipe hit the upright steel casing which the Deceased was cutting and then struck the Deceased.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       The Deceased was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital but succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead on 3 September 2016 at 6.26pm.

After Rahim had secured the self-locking hook to the lifting point of the tremie pipe, Rahim gave instructions by using a whistle and hand signals, to PW5 Miah to lift up the tremie pipe. PW5 Miah in turn gave a signal to PW7 Ramalingam to retract the wire rope of the crane. The tremie pipe was lifted and suspended in a vertical position. PW7 Ramalingam lifted and moved the tremie pipe 2-3m away from the tremie pipe storage area.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     At that point, PW5 Miah saw that there was soil accumulated on the tremie pipe. PW5 Miah gave a signal to PW7 Ramalingam to lower and shift the tremie pipe towards him so that he could clean the tremie pipe. Instead, PW7 Ramalingam started to “shake” the suspended tremie pipe in an up-down manner twice.

Noting that the tremie pipe was 12 metres long and weighed 500 kg, there would also have been a high degree of potential harm to the workers within the vicinity of the bored piling works when the workers were unaware of the risks involved in the cleaning of tremie pipes and/or were untrained and briefed on the proper and safe procedure of cleaning the tremie pipes<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.

On the evidence, I found that a large part of the attendant risks with the use of tremie pipes had been considered by the Accused Company.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     Tremie pipes were apparatus used largely in the course of bored piling works. Their use was spelt out at [23] of the Amended Agreed Statement of Facts. It was undisputed that apart from having a Method Statement for Bored Piling<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>, the Accused Company had conducted a Risk Assessment (RA) in respect of bored piling works at the workplace<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and had also considered risks involved with the installation of bored piling works<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     As highlighted by the Defence, in Exhibit PB-120 (RA, item 7, column 1b), the Accused Company had considered the work and risk of the installation of the tremie pipe. In the same RA, at column 1c, the Accused Company also recognised a potential hazard of a “<em>worker hit by tremie pipe</em>” and in column 2(a), stated the measures necessary to prevent the hazard: “<em>cordon off the working area, keep the safety clearance, ensure clear communication between lifting team and crane operator, no suspended load is allowed…safety helmet, safety shoes, reflective vest</em>.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     In my assessment of the evidence, whilst I found that the cleaning of the tremie pipes was a distinct and separate work activity from the installation of the tremie pipes (cleaning was an activity taken prior to or after its installation) which the Accused Company was obliged to address their minds to, there were several areas of risks associated with the use of tremie pipes in bored piling works which had in fact, been properly considered by the Accused Company.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     One of the breaches described the Accused Company as “<em>failing to ensure that the lifting team have adequate instructions, information and training to perform cleaning and removal of soil from the tremie pipe</em>”. On the evidence, it was clear that a large part of the work process in bored piling works which used tremie pipes, involved lifting. Further, one of the dangers and risks involved with the cleaning of the tremie pipes come from it having to be lifted. Where lifting was concerned, I found that the Accused Company had considered the risks of lifting operations<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. They recognised that lifting operations were high risk operations and had drawn up a lifting plan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> which addressed certain hazards associated with lifting. Hence, whilst the Accused Company had failed to separately consider the specific work activity of the cleaning of the tremie pipes, I found that a key aspect of the work activity involving the use of tremie pipes i.e. lifting, had been duly addressed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     Further, whilst I was satisfied that the Accused Company had committed the breaches relating to the specific work activity of cleaning of the tremie pipes in this incident, I could not agree with the Prosecution’s submission that these breaches were fundamental and/or arose from a systemic failure to implement adequate risk control<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>, thus enhancing the culpability of the Accused Company.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     There was no evidence that the breaches in respect of the cleaning of tremie pipes were intentional or rash. From the documentation presented in Court, it was clear that the Accused Company had considered the risks involved with the use of tremie pipes, namely the installation of tremie pipes for bored piling work as well as the aspect of lifting which was required when tremie pipes were in use. These were key areas in respect of the use of tremie pipes at a worksite and they had been considered. The Accused Company’s negligence laid in overlooking the specific work activity of cleaning of these tremie pipes and the safety measures necessary for it, despite having considered other major areas of risks surrounding the use of tremie pipes on the worksite.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     The breaches of the Accused Company in this case were more isolated than systemic. Prosecution submitted that the breaches pre-dated the accident and the measures outlined in the charge were not in place from the time the bored piling works started until the accident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. This fact, whilst it may be true, could not on its own, demonstrate that the breaches of the Accused Company were systemic in the sense that it led to an inference that such breaches were pervasive in the Accused’s Company safety system. What the evidence and documentation produced in court showed was that the risks involved with the use of tremie pipes had been largely considered by the Accused Company; it was in respect of the specific activity of the cleaning of tremie pipes that they had failed to address their minds to. This was a particular part of the entire system which they had overlooked. I agreed with the Defence that the Accused Company’s breach of its duty in this instance was more of an isolated incident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>, than a systemic one.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     An objective evaluation of the incident which occurred on the worksite that fateful day revealed a coincidence of unfortunate events which resulted in the death of the Deceased:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"/>(a)     PW7 Ramalingam chose to shake the suspended tremie pipe twice, in an up-down fashion in an attempt to get rid of soil found on the tremie pipe,</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"/>(b)     Because the mechanism used to attach the tremie pipe to the crane was not the most suitable one (even though approved for use), this led to the dislodging of the tremie pipe from the self-locking hook;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"/>(c)     The Deceased, who was not authorized to be working in the vicinity, happened to be there when he decided to carry out the work required of him that day instead of another day.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     The failings of the Accused Company contributed to the death of the Deceased but were not a direct cause of it. As much as I was acutely aware that had the Accused Company analysed the risks involved with cleaning of the tremie pipes and given the requisite training and instructions to the workers, the accident might not have occurred, the fact remained that the crane operator PW7 Ramalingam’s act of shaking the pipe and the failure of the self-locking hook were the direct causes of the accident. This was accepted by the Prosecution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. Taking it one step further, even if the Accused company had conscientiously undertaken all the measures outlined in the charge in relation to the cleaning of tremie pipes, the fatal accident may still have happened if PW7 Ramalingam, a licensed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, certified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> and experienced crane operator of eight years, had chosen to shake the tremie pipe to clean it against instruction and training when it was suspended on a self-locking hook. Such is the “<em>unpredictability of human behaviour</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     I reiterate the clear position that had the Accused Company identified the work activity of tremie pipe cleaning, assessed the risks involved with tremie pipe cleaning and given proper instruction and training to the workers on how to clean a tremie pipe, PW7 Ramalingam may not have shaken the tremie pipe in an attempt to get rid of the soil on the tremie pipe, and the Deceased may not have died. However, the role of the Accused Company in the entire incident, whilst cannot in any way be minimized, should also not be over-stated.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     On the unique circumstances of this case, I was satisfied that the culpability of the Accused Company was low.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Indicative Starting Sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     Having assessed harm to be “<em>high</em>” and culpability to be “<em>low</em>”, the appropriate sentence would be in the range of $150,000 to $225,000, as provided for in the benchmarks in <em>Manta Equipment</em>. Bearing in mind the facts and circumstances of how the accident had occurred, I was of the view that the indicative starting sentence would be in the lower end of the range of sentence prescribed for this band i.e. $150,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Offender-Specific Factors</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     Moving on to the second stage of the sentencing framework, I considered the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors present in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     I did not find any aggravating factors in this case. No aggravating factors were suggested or submitted by the Prosecution. I was mindful that no discount in sentencing should be accorded as the Accused Company elected to claim trial. That said, I need only to make an observation that it was essentially the process of trial and testimony of witnesses which greatly assisted to elucidate the full facts and investigations relating to the accident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     As for mitigating factors, there were several, as highlighted by Defence Counsel<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. The Accused Company was a first offender and did not have any breaches under WSHA prior to this incident; it had a good health and safety record.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     After the incident, the Accused Company cooperated with the authorities to deal with the Stop-Work order that was issued to the worksite. The Accused Company took steps to review their risk assessment, safe work procedure and method statement. Prosecution urged the Court not to place too much weight on the post-accident measures taken by the Accused Company because they were taken in response to the Stop-Work order that was imposed. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) required the Accused Company to take all reasonably practicable steps towards ensuring the safety of workers before allowing it to resume work at the accident location<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. The Accused Company’s representative, DW1 Tey Choon Chee candidly stated that post-accident measures were taken so that MOM would lift the Stop-Work Order and allow them to resume work<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     Be that as it may, I recognised that compliance with a Stop-Work Order issued by MOM could be approached in different ways. In some cases, it may be done in a cursory manner with a minimum level of effort - just so that works may be allowed to resume at the worksite.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     In this case, I was satisfied that the Accused Company had taken the accident seriously and were genuine in their efforts to comply with the Stop-Work Order. From the moment the accident occurred, the Accused Company’s representative, Director<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and General Manager<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> (a key officer of the Accused Company) DW1 Tey Choon Chee took it upon himself to extend as much assistance as he could to the family of the Deceased. Upon hearing about the accident, he obtained the contact details of the family members and on the day itself, drove into Malaysia to personally fetch the Deceased’s wife and children to the hospital where the Deceased had been brought to, only to learn enroute that the Deceased had passed away. The very next day, he tried to make arrangements for a funeral parlour to send the Deceased’s body back to Malaysia<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. In the days following, the Accused Company, along with others, undertook internal investigations<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> into the matter and an investigation report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> was put up in respect of the accident that had taken place.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     I placed weight on the fact that the Accused Company had been very helpful and co-operative with the authorities during the investigation of the matter. I agreed with Defence Counsel that the importance of co-operating with the authorities could not be understated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>. Cooperation with the authorities saves the authorities precious time and resources that would have otherwise been expanded by having to conduct potentially protracted and tedious investigations into the accident.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     As rightly pointed out by the Defence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>, the Court at [46] of <em>Manta Equipment</em>, similarly accepted the offender-company’s cooperation with the investigations, an unblemished safety record and the post-accident rectification works, as mitigating factors.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     With these mitigating factors in play, I calibrated the fine downwards. I was of the view that a fine of $100,000 would be a fair and proportionate sentence for the Accused Company.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"/>53     At [9] of the Defence’s Submissions on Sentence was a quote by the Minister for Manpower, Dr Ng Eng Hen (as he then was) at the Second Reading of the Workplace Safety and Health Bill:-</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1"> <em>"Even as we work with industry to build up their capabilities to improve safety and health at their workplaces, we need to ensure that the penalties for non-compliance are sufficiently high to effect a cultural change on the ground. Penalties should be set at a level that reflects the true costs of poor safety management, including the costs of disruptions and inconvenience to members of the public which workplace accidents may cause….. However, the penalty, in any given case, will be applied taking into account all the relevant circumstances, including the culpability of the offender, the potential harm that could have been caused, and the harm actually done.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>"</em> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"/>54     Having considered the level of harm and culpability of the Accused Company in this case, the overall circumstances as well as the mitigating factors present, I was satisfied that the fine of $100,000 imposed on the Accused Company, was a fair and just outcome in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"/>55     In a case involving a needless death of a worker at a worksite, a visceral response may sometimes be to impose an over-compensatory sentence on the Accused Company, for failing to take practicable measures which may have prevented such death. The role and culpability of the Accused Company in this entire incident which led to a death, cannot be glossed over. However, the nature of this accident reminds us that in certain situations, even a full and comprehensive set of safe work procedures which are wholly necessary, may not be sufficient to counter human error, irresponsibility and/or negligence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"/>56     As informed by the Prosecution, the crane operator, PW7 Ramalingam Sudhakar, was sentenced to 11 weeks’ imprisonment for an offence under section 15(3A) WSHA on 7 April 2022, for his role in the incident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Amended Agreed Statement of Facts dated 11 March 2021, [4]-[6]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>Amended Agreed Statement of Facts dated 11 March 2021, [2]- [3]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup>Amended Agreed Statement of Facts dated 11 March 2021, [12]-[18]</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Witness not in Singapore;
