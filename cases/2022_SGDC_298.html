id="p1_1"/>1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused on his breach of probation. The Accused had pleaded guilty to three charges: two for theft in a dwelling place with common intention under section 380 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) read with section 34 of the PC and another charge for possession of an offensive weapon under section 22(1)(a) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, Rev Ed 1997).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       The Accused admitted and consented to two other charges of theft in a dwelling place with common intention to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       He was sentenced on 24 October 2019 to 24 months’ probation, which probation period would have ended by 23 October 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       However, he committed further offences during his term of probation. On 13 August 2021, he committed two offences of cheating against 2 different banks under section 417 of the PC. He pleaded guilty before another District Judge for these offences and thereafter he was sentenced to reformative training for a period of 12 months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       After he was convicted and sentenced on those two charges, he was brought before me to be dealt with on the breach of the probation order issued by me.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       As he was found unsuitable by the Probation Officer who prepared his progress report (“the Progress Report”), I had revoked his probation order and sentenced him afresh for the offences he had pleaded guilty to earlier before me.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       I sentenced him similarly to a term of reformative training for 12 months to undergo level 2 intensity of training, which order was to run concurrently with the sentence of reformative training imposed on his fresh offences<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       Being dissatisfied with the sentence, the Accused has filed a notice of appeal against sentence imposed by this Court. He had also filed an appeal against the sentence of reformative training imposed on him for the fresh offences<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The Accused has been released on bail pending the appeals.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       I now set out the grounds of my decision.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">THE STATEMENT OF FACTS</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     The Accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background Information</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     I set out the facts as contained in the Statement of Facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     The Accused, a male Singaporean, was a 16-year-old (Date of Birth: 10 October 2002) student the time of the three offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts pertaining to the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge (DAC-922743-2019)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     The co-accused was also a 16 -year-old male Singaporean, who was a student and friend of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     The Complainant was the store manager at a Giant supermarket located at Block 266, Serangoon Central Drive (“the supermarket”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     On 22 March 2019 at about 11.10 p.m. the Accused and the co-accused had gone into the supermarket with the dishonest intention to steal beer. At about 11.20 p.m., pursuant to their plan to steal, each of them dishonestly took a can of beer out of the possession of the Complainant without his consent and left the supermarket without paying for the beer. A witness spotted them leaving the supermarket with two cans of beer without paying. The witness followed them and saw them consuming the beer. The witness then alerted the Complainant who called for the police.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     The stolen items are two cans of ‘Baron’ Extra Strong Brew 500 ml beer valued at S$7.90/- each, amounting to a total of S$15.80.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     The Accused, in furtherance of the common intention to steal with the co-accused, at the said supermarket, which is a building used for the custody of property, did commit theft of the abovementioned items and has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 380 read with section 34 of the PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge (MAC-908234-2019) </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     The Complainant was the Discipline Master at Bartley Secondary School, located at No.10, Jalan Bunga Rampai, Singapore (‘the school’).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     The Accused was a student at the school.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     On 14 January 2019, at about 8.52 a.m., the Complainant was conducting a random bag check of the students in the school, when he found a knife inside the Accused’s school bag. The Accused admitted to be in possession of the said knife and that it belonged to him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     He further admitted that he brought along the knife in case he needed it for self-defence. The description of the knife is as follows:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_i"/>(i)     One “Pedrini” paring knife with blade measuring 6 cm in length (“the knife”)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     The Accused had in his possession the knife without lawful authority or a lawful purpose, and has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance Act, Chapter 184.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Facts relating to the 4<sup>th</sup> Charge (DAC-925209 -2019)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     The Complainant was an assistant manager for a McDonald’s outlet located at No.1, Hougang Street 91, Singapore (“the McDonald’s outlet”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     The co-accused was a 15-year-old male student and a friend of the Accused at the time of the offence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     On 18 June 2019 at about 2.00 p.m., one of the McDonald’s staff discovered the charity donation box that was placed at the cashier counter of the McDonald’s outlet was missing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     The Complainant proceeded to view the Closed Circuit Television (‘CCTV’) recording and discovered that on 9 June 2019 at about 5.00 a.m., two male subjects were seen dismantling the chain that had secured the donation box and leaving the McDonald’s outlet with it at about 5.17 a.m.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     The two male subjects were subsequently established to be the Accused and the coaccused. The Accused admitted that he had planned with the co-accused to steal the donation box from the said outlet to obtain cash for themselves. The Accused who was wearing a jacket was captured on CCTV to have concealed the donation box under his jacket before leaving the McDonald’s outlet. The donation box contained cash amounting to about $90.00.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     After leaving the McDonald, the Accused and the co-accused broke the donation box and split the money. The accused claimed that he received $60/- as his share.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     The Accused, in furtherance of the common intention to steal with the co-accused, on 9 June 2019 at about 5.00 a.m., at the McDonald’s outlet, which is a building used for the custody of property, did commit theft of the donation box containing cash amounting to a total of $90.00. The Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 380 read with Section 34 of the PC.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">ANTECEDENTS</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     The Accused did not have any previous convictions at the material time when he pleaded guilty to the above set of offences.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE ON BREACH</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     The Prosecution noted that the Accused had been sentenced to reformative training in respect of the new offences and did not address the court further on the sentence for the breach of probation.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">MITIGATION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     The Accused did not say anything in mitigation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     When asked about the contents of the Progress Report tendered by his Probation Officer, he said he agreed with it.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">THE COURT’S DECISION ON SENTENCE </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sentencing principles </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     When it is proved that a probationer has been convicted and dealt with in respect of an offence committed during the probation period, the court “may deal with the probationer for the offence for which the order of probation was made, in any manner in which the court could deal with him as if he had just been convicted by that court for that offence”, pursuant to section 9(5) of the Probation of Offenders Act 1951.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     Whilst it is established that the primary sentencing consideration would be one of rehabilitation when dealing with young offenders below 21 years of age, different considerations would apply when such a young person had already been previously placed on probation. The issue of whether an offender who re-offended during probation can be given another round of probation was dealt with in the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a>. The High Court had held that while the fact that a youthful offender was already under probation when he committed the offence in question was not a bar to a second sentence of probation, it was incumbent on the offender to satisfy the court that probation remained a viable option and there was no reason in all the circumstances to opt for a sentence that had a greater emphasis on deterrence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     The High Court went on to set out the following factors that a court should take into account when deciding whether a second sentence of probation should be imposed:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_i"/>(i)     whether the latest offence in question is serious;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_ii"/>(ii)     whether the offender’s pattern of offending displaces the focus on rehabilitation or at least mandated greater emphasis on deterrence;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_iii"/>(iii)     whether there is evidence of genuine remorse;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_iv"/>(iv)     whether there is cause for assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail had been addressed; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_v"/>(v)     whether there are any countervailing considerations such as the public interest in prevention or deterrence that militate against a second order of probation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     Applying these factors to the present case, I found that it would not be appropriate to grant the Accused a second round of probation. I highlight the more relevant factors as follows.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">The latest offences were serious</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     On the fresh offences, the Accused had admitted in his Statement of Facts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> that in July 2021, that after coming across a message, sent on an unspecified Telegram group by one “Bay”, offering fast cash for the opening of bank account, he had contacted “Bay” in early August 2021. “Bay” told the Accused that he would be given “around $400” if he were to open a bank account with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) or Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) and hand over the Automated Teller Machine (the “ATM”) card and Personal Identification Number (“PIN”) (the “scheme”).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     The Accused agreed to participate in the scheme. He informed “Bay” that he would open two bank accounts, one with UOB and another with OCBC, in exchange for $800. Pursuant to the scheme, the Accused had applied for 2 bank accounts, one with UOB and another with OCBC on 13 August 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     In both applications, the Accused had declared that he would be the ultimate beneficial owner of the bank account that he was applying for, a fact which he knew at the time to be false.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     As a result of the Accused’s deception, UOB and OCBC had approved the applications, an act which they would not have done if they had not been so deceived, and which was likely to cause harm to their reputation. The Accused subsequently handed the ATM card and PIN linked to both bank accounts to “Bay”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     Police investigations later revealed that the UOB account had been the subject of at least 27 police reports involving a reported total loss of at least $129,591.70. The UOB account’s bank statements also showed that it had been used to receive a total of $214,353.38 in 85 separate transactions from 31 August to 2 September 2021. By the time the UOB account was frozen pursuant to police investigations, the vast majority of the monies had been dissipated and only a balance of $0.67 remained.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     Police investigations revealed that the OCBC account had been the subject of at least 12 police reports involving a reported total loss of at least $21,106.20. The OCBC account’s bank statements also showed that it had been used to receive a total of $29,664.68 in 38 separate transactions from 22 to 23 August 2021. By the time the OCBC account was frozen pursuant to police investigations, the vast majority of the monies had been dissipated and only a balance of $1.00 remained.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     Hence, the fresh offences committed by the Accused were serious in that actual and substantial harm was caused. Through his act of opening up the bank accounts and thereafter handing over the control of these accounts, he had facilitated the dissipation of monies belonging to many victims.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Pattern of offending and his response towards rehabilitation efforts</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     In terms of pattern of offending, it can be said that the Accused’s offending had escalated from relatively minor offences of theft to cheating of banks resulting in substantial harm.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     The Accused’s escalation in offending came about despite having already undergone almost the full probation period of 2 years. He had reoffended just 2 months before completion of his probation. This shows that the Accused had failed to internalise the values taught to him over a period of 22 months. As highlighted in the Progress Report by his Probation Officer at para 9.1 and 9.2:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.1    Jie Ren’s offences stemmed from greed. Despite intervention prior to being placed on probation and during probation, his involvement in further offences indicated that he continued to harbour pro-criminal attitudes. He disregarded the consequences of breaking the law to achieve his wants.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.2    Jie Ren had carried over little positives from his rehabilitation into post probation. He showed limited motivation for constructive pursuits as reflected by his prolonged absence from National Service.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether there was any evidence of genuine remorse </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     The Accused did not display any concrete evidence of genuine remorse after the commission of the offences other than his plea of guilt. He still showed a reckless disregard for authority and was not averse to taking the easy way out as evidenced by his long period of leave from national service. It was reported in the Progress Report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> that since 1 Jan 2022, the Accused was on medical leave for more than 120 days. The Accused admitted that he did not like the military regime and found the duties in camp to be boring. Therefore, he obtained Medical Certificates (MCs) to avoid returning to camp. He consulted doctors from virtual platforms and obtained between 2 to 5 days of MCs each time citing illness such as flu, cough and headaches. He then spent his time at home sleeping or scrolling through social media using his mobile phone. He persisted with this behaviour despite advice from his Probation Officer.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether there is cause for assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail had been addressed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     Sadly, there appears to be no change in his indulgent attitude and no increase in any protective factors. His parents would be obviously disappointed that the Accused was not able to change his ways but unfortunately they themselves were at a loss as to how to improve the situation. His parents were not confident that the Accused would heed their advice. As opined in the Progress Report, despite their best efforts, they had been unable to influence the Accused positively<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">CONCLUSION</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     I found that given his lack of motivation to change, it would be a futile exercise to place the Accused on another round of probation. However, given his young age, rehabilitation would still be a relevant and important sentencing consideration. The fresh offences committed by the Accused warranted a more deterrent sentence but they were not so serious as to displace rehabilitation as a dominant sentencing principle.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     The Accused was found physically and mentally suitable for a term of reformative training. The Reformative Training report recommended a Level Two intensity of rehabilitation in the Reformative Training Centre to address the risk factors of the Accused.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     Hence, I am of the view that reformative training with a stronger emphasis on discipline within a confined environment would serve to be more effective to achieve this goal of rehabilitation.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     My view is further reinforced by the fact that the Accused had also been placed on reformative training for his fresh offences. Therefore, a concurrent sentence of reformative for the same period for the re-sentencing of his previous offences would be most appropriate without further lengthening the period of his incarceration.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"/>53     I had accordingly sentenced the Accused to reformative training for 12 months to undergo level 2 intensity of training.</p> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup><em>PP v Mak Jie Ren</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29108-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGMC 70</a></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_2_1" id="Ftn_2">[note: 2]</a></sup>MA 9227/2022/01</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_3_1" id="Ftn_3">[note: 3]</a></sup><em>PP v Mak Jie Ren</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29108-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGMC 70</a></p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_4_1" id="Ftn_4">[note: 4]</a></sup>Progress Report at paragraph 5.1.2 to 5.1.4</p><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_5_1" id="Ftn_5">[note: 5]</a></sup>Progress Report at paragraphs 7.1 and 9.2</p></div></content></root> </div> <form name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm" action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap4 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner" > <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
