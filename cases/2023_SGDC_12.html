District Judge Toh Yung Cheong:</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"/>1       This is an appeal by the Plaintiff against the decision of the Deputy Registrar in respect of a preliminary issue at an interlocutory hearing for DC/AD 344/2021. The issue in dispute is the District Court’s civil jurisdiction where a claim in excess of the District Court limit (“DC limit”) of $250,000 is filed by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff invokes s.22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 to abandon the excess amount, what is the maximum amount the plaintiff can be awarded if damages are to be reduced on account of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       While this issue appeared to have been decided by the Court of Appeal in <em>Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 2 SLR(R) 0839.xml')">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 839</a>, the Deputy Registrar hearing the assessment of damages<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> agreed with the decision in <em>Au Eong Poh Choo, Serene v Singapore Swimming Club</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28835-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 226</a> (“Serene Au”) that the legal position in <em>Keppel</em> was no longer applicable as s.19 of the State Courts Act was different from the provision considered by the Court of Appeal. In particular, it lacked the words “whether on balance of account or otherwise” which the Deputy Registrar felt was crucial to the Court of Appeal’s decision. The Deputy Registrar agreed with the decision in <em>Serene Au</em> and found that the removal of those key words meant that the legal position had changed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       During the hearing of this appeal, the plaintiff urged the Court to find that the legal position in <em>Keppel</em> had not changed as a result of this amendment.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural History</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       The plaintiff was a pedestrian who was injured by a motor car driven by the defendant on 8 December 2019. The writ was filed on 30 November 2020. On 3 May 2021, a consent interlocutory judgment was entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for 80% of the damages to be assessed. The matter was then set down for an assessment of damages hearing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       In the Joint Opening Statement (“JOS”) for Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury Claims<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> prepared for the Assessment of Damages hearing, the plaintiff put forward a total claim of $734,168.31. After taking into account the 20% reduction agreed upon, the claim was $587,334.65. The plaintiff took the position that it was sufficient for the Court to record that he was abandoning the excess claim under s.22(1) and that the maximum amount that he could recover was $250,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Identification of Issues</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues framed by the Deputy Registrar and her decision on the issues</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       At the hearing below, the Deputy Registrar framed the following two issues:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>First Issue:</u> If the Plaintiff is relying on s.22 of the State Courts Act, whether the Plaintiff has to first abandon the excess (i.e. by effectively re-quantifying the claim).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Second Issue:</u> Whether the “amount claimed” in s.19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 refers to the amount claimed on a 100% basis or the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       In respect of the first issue, Deputy held that the plaintiff was required to re-quantify the claim by amending the claim amount of $734,168.31 in the JOS to the DC limit of $250,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       In respect of the second issue, the Deputy Registrar held that the “amount claimed” refers to the amount claimed on a 100% basis and any reduction for contributory negligence would be from the DC limit rather than the damages actually assessed. This meant that any reduction due to contributory negligence would be from the re-quantified claim of $250,000.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues to be dealt with at this appeal</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       I agreed with the Plaintiff that the issue of whether the plaintiff’s share of contributory negligence must be reduced from the DC limit has to be considered separately.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Therefore, I approached this appeal on the basis that there were three separate issues:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>First Issue :</u> Whether the words “amount claimed” refer to the amount claimed on a 100% basis.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Second Issue:</u> Does the plaintiff have to re-quantify his claim in order to “abandon the excess amount” under s.22 of the Act?</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"/>(c)      <u>Third Issue:</u> Third Issue: Is the reduction for contributory negligence made from damages assessed or from the DC limit?</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Keppel Singmarine and the Legislative Provisions</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     Before I begin my analysis of the issues, I will deal with the applicability of the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 2 SLR(R) 0839.xml')">[2008] 2 SLR(R) 839</a> (“Keppel”). In <em>Keppel</em>, the plaintiff was injured in an industrial accident and commenced proceedings in the District Court. Parties later entered into a consent interlocutory judgment with the defendant accepting 70% liability with damages to be assessed. A dispute arose as to the maximum amount the District Court could award on the basis of 70% liability.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     The applicable provisions before the Court of Appeal in <em>Keppel</em> were sections 20(1) and s.22(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Chapter 321, 1999 Revised Edition) which I reproduce below for ease of reference:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.—(1)    A District Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and try any action founded on contract or tort where — Singapore Statutes Online Revised Edition published on 01 Aug 1999 PDF created date on: 24 Jan 2023 (a) the debt, demand or damage claimed does not exceed the DC limit, whether on balance of account or otherwise;</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.—(1)    Where a plaintiff has a cause of action which exceeds the DC limit in which, if it did not exceed the DC limit, a District Court would have jurisdiction under section 20(1) (a) or (2) or 21, the plaintiff may abandon the excess and thereupon a District Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and try the action, provided that the plaintiff shall not recover in the action an amount exceeding the DC limit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     The Court of Appeal explained that the disposal of the appeal rested on the interpretation of the words “or otherwise” in s.20(1)(a) of the Subordinate Courts Act and that these words were wide enough to include a situation where any reduction of the damages awarded due to the plaintiff’s contributory negligence would operate on the damages actually assessed and not on the DC limit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> If the legal position in <em>Keppel</em> was applicable to the present case, it would effectively dispose of this appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     However, as the Deputy Registrar in <em>Au Eong Poh Choo, Serene v Singapore Swimming Club</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28835-SSP.xml')">[2022] SGDC 226</a> noted, the words “or otherwise” are not present in s.19(4) of the State Courts Act. For ease of reference, I reproduce s.19(4) and s.22(1):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">19 (4)    Subject to sections 22 and 23, a District Court’s jurisdiction under subsection (2) does not include jurisdiction to hear and try any action where —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">the amount claimed in the action exceeds the DC limit; or</span></p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">any remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the DC limit.</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">22 (1)    Where —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">the amount claimed in an action exceeds the DC limit, or any remedy or relief sought in an action is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the DC limit; and</span></p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">a District Court would have jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action if the amount or value (as the case may be) did not exceed the DC limit,</span></p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">the claimant may abandon the excess amount or that remedy or relief, as the case may be, and thereupon a District Court has jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action, except that the claimant cannot in that action —</p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">recover an amount exceeding the DC limit; and</span></p> <p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(d)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">obtain any remedy or relief in respect of the subject matter the value of which exceeds the DC limit.</span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     The judgment of <em>Serene Au</em> also traces the legislative history of the amendments and concluded that while there was no indication that Parliament had intended to legislatively overrule <em>Keppel</em>, there was equally no indication that Parliament had intended to maintain the legal position in <em>Keppel.</em> As I agree with the conclusion in <em>Serene Au</em> that the Parliamentary records are inconclusive, I did not make reference to them in this judgment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     In conclusion, the words “or otherwise” appear to form the basis of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Keppel.</em> As the words “or otherwise” are not found in the present State Courts Act, the legal position in <em>Keppel Singmarine</em> is not applicable to the present case and the issue has to be considered afresh. I will now begin my analysis of the three issues.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">First Issue: Whether the words “amount claimed” refer to the amount claimed on a 100% basis</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on first issue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     I agree with the interpretation adopted by the Deputy Registrar (who agreed with the reasoning in <em>Serene Au</em>) that the words “amount claimed” in s.19(4)(a) of the Act refer to the amount claimed on a 100% basis and not the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account. Therefore, s.19(4)(a) operates to exclude the District Court’s jurisdiction when the amount claimed exceeds the DC limit and this is on 100% basis and before any reduction for contributory negligence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s submission on the first issue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     The Plaintiff urged the Court to adopt a purposive interpretation to s.19(4). As there was no evidence that Parliament intended to legislatively overrule <em>Keppel</em>, s.19(4) should be interpreted in a manner that preserves the legal position in <em>Keppel</em>. In addition, the Plaintiff pointed out that the Deputy Registrar’s decision would lead to higher costs for claimants and encourage cases to be needlessly commenced in the High Court.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision in Serene Au</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     In <em>Serene Au</em> four main factors were put forward in support of the interpretation of “amount claimed” as referring to amount claimed on a 100% basis:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>First Factor:</u> There is a distinction between the Court’s <em>jurisdiction</em> and its <em>powers</em>. Section 19(4) of the Act deals with the District Court’s jurisdiction and this has to be determined at the outset of the matter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Second Factor:</u> The interpretation ensures coherence with the operation of paras 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"/>(c)      <u>Third Factor:</u> The interpretation promotes certainty as to whether certain civil claims ought to be commenced in the High Court or the District Court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"/>(d)      <u>Fourth Factor:</u> The competing interpretation leads to a situation where a defendant in a case where liability is resolved separately from quantum is left open to a potentially larger award than a defendant in a case where liability is not resolved separately from quantum.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     The first and second factors form the basis of my decision on this issue. In respect of the third factor of promoting certainty, the lack of further litigation on this issue after <em>Keppel</em> was decided suggests that litigants found the uncertainty caused by the decision to be manageable. As for the fourth factor, I note that my decision on the third issue avoids a situation where the size of the award depends on whether or not liability is resolved separately from quantum.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">First factor: Jurisdiction</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     Section 19 is a provision that confers jurisdiction on a District Court to hear certain types of claims. Section 19(4) states that subject to sections 22 and 23 (as my discussion of Issue 2 will show, this is quite an important caveat but I leave it to one side for now), the District Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear and try any action where the “amount claimed” in the action exceeds the DC limit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     The jurisdiction of a court is its authority, however derived, to hear and determine a dispute that was brought before it. If a court had the power to grant a remedy or make a certain order, it could only exercise that power in a subject matter in which it had jurisdiction: <em>Muhd Munir v Noor Hidah and other applications</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1990] 2 SLR(R) 0348.xml')">[1990] 2 SLR(R) 348</a> at [19].</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     Therefore, it would be important to know at the time the writ and statement of claim is filed, whether the District Court has the jurisdiction to hear or try the action. At the time of filing, only the amount claimed on a 100% basis can be quantified while the amount claimed after taking into contributory negligence cannot.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Second factor: The 2016 Order </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     The words “amount claimed” are also found in the operation of paras 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016. The Order confers jurisdiction on a District Court to hear certain types of cases where the “amount claimed” exceeds the DC limit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Since the Order also uses the words “amount claimed” in the context of conferring jurisdiction, these words should have a consistent meaning.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     The Deputy Registrar in <em>Serene Au</em> stated at [40]:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">These paragraphs essentially provide that certain motor accident and industrial accident proceedings commenced in the High Court/General Division of the High Court are transferred for hearing and determination in the District Court “where the <b><em>amount claimed</em></b> in the action does not exceed $500,000” [emphasis added]. As the Defendant submitted, these transfers take place shortly after the claim is filed and before liability is determined. Indeed, I understand that these transfers take place automatically once the claim is filed. Again, at that stage, only the amount claimed on a 100% basis can be quantified; the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account cannot. Thus, for the purposes of paras 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016, “the amount claimed” must refer to the amount claimed on a 100% basis.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     As the Deputy Registrar pointed out, since the Order operates automatically to transfer the case on the basis that the “amount claimed” does not exceed $500,000, it presupposes that the “amount claimed” is one that is quantified from the outset and contributory negligence is not considered when determining whether the order applies.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the first issue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     In conclusion, if a plaintiff files a claim where the quantified claim exceeds the DC limit of $250,000:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"/>(a)     The District Court does not have the jurisdiction under s.19(2) to hear and try the action in light of s.19(4).</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"/>(b)     Section 19(4) is subject to s.22 and s.23. How s.22 operates is the focus of the second and third issues.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"/>(c)     The fact that the damages recoverable is likely to be reduced on account of the Plaintiff’s contributory negligence is not relevant to determining whether the District Court’s jurisdiction is excluded by s.19(4).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second Issue: Does the plaintiff have to re-quantify his claim in order to “abandon the excess amount” under s.22 of the Act?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     I now turn to the second issue, which involves deciding what a plaintiff who wishes to abandon the excess amount under s.22(1) is required to do:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>First approach</u>: Plaintiff is required to re-quantify his claim.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Second approach</u>: Re-quantification is not required. It is sufficient for the Plaintiff to limit or cap his claim at the appropriate jurisdictional limit.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Deputy Registrar’s decision on the second issue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     The Deputy Registrar adopted the first approach and held that a plaintiff who wished to abandon the excess amount pursuant to s.22(1) was required to re-quantify the claim to $250,000 (or less) on a 100% basis:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he Plaintiff’s mere confirmation that the award is to be capped at the DC jurisdictional limit will not suffice</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">it is for the Plaintiff to abandon the excess and re-quantify the claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     The Deputy Registrar gave the following reasons for her decision:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"/>(a)     The duty was on the claimant and not the court to hive off the excess amount of the claim, given that not all claims are homogenous and that general and special damages attract different rates of pre-judgment interest (endorsing <em>K Jeyakumar Naikar v Huationg Contractor Pte Ltd and another</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26356-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 146</a> at [16] which also adopted the first approach)</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"/>(b)     The approach was consonant with the second part of s.22(1) which refers to the District Court having jurisdiction under s.19(2) to hear and try the action except that the Plaintiff cannot recover more than the DC limit.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s submission on the second issue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     The Plaintiff submitted that there was no legal requirement to re-quantify the claim under s.22(1) and that re-quantification was not required in previous District Court cases such as <em>Serene Au.</em> In addition, it was highlighted to the Deputy Registrar that the Registrar’s appeal in <em>K Jeyakumar Naikar</em> had been allowed.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Decision on second issue</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     I was of the view that there is no legal requirement for the plaintiff to re-quantify his claim and that it is sufficient if it is recorded in writing that he is abandoning the excess amount pursuant to s.22.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     As the Plaintiff in this case has informed the Court in his written submissions that he is capping the claim at the DC limit, he has complied with s.22 and the Court has jurisdiction to hear the action.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     I am of the view that Section 22 does not impose any duty on the plaintiff to re-quantify the claim and implying a requirement of re-quantification is not necessary. When a plaintiff files a claim in excess of the DC limit and invokes s.22, the claim can then be heard in the District Court. There are two approaches to understanding how s.22 operates:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"/>(a)      <u>Confers Jurisdiction:</u> Under this approach, the District Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the action as s.19(4) operates to exclude the jurisdiction of the District Court. However, if the plaintiff satisfies all of its requirements including abandoning the excess amount under s.22, the section confers jurisdiction on the District Court to hear the action.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"/>(b)      <u>Does not confer jurisdiction:</u> Under this approach, the District Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the action as s.19(4) operates to exclude the jurisdiction of the District Court. Section 22 does not confer jurisdiction but indicates what the plaintiff needs to do in order for the District Court to have jurisdiction under s.19(2) which is to re-quantify the claim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     I am of the view that the first approach is correct and that upon satisfying the requirements in s.22, jurisdiction is conferred on the District Court to hear the action:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"/>(a)     Section 19(4), which excludes the jurisdiction of the Court to hear cases above the DC limit, is expressed to be “subject to s.22 and s.23.” Given that s.19(4) operates to exclude the District Court’s jurisdiction in certain cases, this suggests that s.22 and s.23 are also provisions that can modify the District Court’s jurisdiction. If all s.22 is doing is telling plaintiffs to re-quantify their claim to $250,000 or less, there is no need for s.19(4) to be subject to it.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"/>(b)     Section 23 confers on the District Court the jurisdiction to hear cases where the amount claimed is above the DC limit upon the signing of the requisite memorandum. Even though s.23 refers to jurisdiction under s.19(2), it is clear that <em>without s.23</em>, it would not be possible for s.19(2) to give the District Court the jurisdiction to hear such a claim. I am of the view that section 22 operates in a similar manner to confer jurisdiction on the District Court if the plaintiff abandons the excess amount.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"/>(c)     Section 22(2) begins with the clause “Where a District Court has <em>jurisdiction</em> to hear and try an action by <em>virtue of this section</em>.” The words “by virtue of this section” are consistent with section 22 being a provision that confers jurisdiction.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     If section 22 does not confer jurisdiction, it is unclear what function it has. As the Deputy Registrar in <em>Serene Au</em> noted at [24], if the Plaintiff re-quantifies his claim such that it is now within the DC limit, there would not be any need for the section as the claim is now within the limit and s.22 no longer applies (section 22 only applies in cases where the amount claimed exceeds the DC limit). Conversely, if the abandonment of the excess means that the claim still remains above the DC limit, this would give meaning to sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) which prevent the plaintiff from recovering an amount exceeding this limit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     In respect of the issue caused by different heads of damage attracting different rates of pre-judgment interest, I agreed with the view of the Deputy Registrar in <em>Serene Au</em> that this was not an insurmountable problem. The suggestion that the Court could prorate the apportionment under the various heads of claim appears to be workable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Third Issue: Is the reduction for contributory made from damages assessed or from the DC limit?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     Having determined that s.22 confers jurisdiction on a District Court to hear an action where the “amount claimed” exceeds the DC limit if the plaintiff abandons the excess amount, I now turn to the third issue. If the District Court has the jurisdiction to hear the case and assess damages and is limited by s.22(1)(c) to making an award within the DC limit, what is the maximum amount the Plaintiff may recover if there is a reduction for contributory negligence?</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     There are two possible approaches:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"/>(a)     Reduction for contributory negligence is made from damages actually assessed.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"/>(b)     Reduction for contributory negligence is made from the DC Court limit (if the damages assessed exceed the DC limit).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     I note that given the Deputy Registrar’s decision that the claim had to be re-quantified to within the DC limit, there was no need for her to consider this issue. If the plaintiff’s claim was re-quantified to $250,000 on a 100% basis, this would necessarily mean that any reduction due to contributory negligence would operate on this amount and the final award would always be within the DC limit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     In my view, the first approach is correct, subject to the limitation in s.22 that the maximum amount the Plaintiff may recover is the District Court limit of $250,000. When hearing a claim in excess of the DC limit, it stands to reason that the District Court has the power to ascertain what would be recoverable if the DC limit did not apply. This calculation would also have to take into account contributory negligence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     After the District Court assesses what would be recoverable and arrives at a final amount, the next question is what orders the Court can make. It is then that reference is made to s.22(1)(c) which indicates that the District Court only has the power to make an award up to the DC limit of $250,000.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     This approach is consistent with the observations of both the Court of Appeal and the High Court in <em>Keppel</em>. I begin with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Keppel</em> where the Court considered s.3(3) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 and noted that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]f a defendant’s liability is limited by contract or written law, any reduction for contributory negligence would operate on the total assessed damages and not on the limits imposed by contract or statute.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">That being the case, we do not see why the courts ought to take a diametrically opposite (and illogical) approach by making reductions for contributory negligence from the District Court limit if the defendant’s liability is limited by the court’s jurisdictional limit under the Act. Instead, the requisite reduction should be made from the damages actually assessed regardless of whether the defendant’s liability is limited by the jurisdictional limit of the court, by contract or by statute.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     The Deputy Registrar in <em>Serene Au</em> cited this passage in his judgment and recognised that it could support the proposition that a reduction of damages due to contributory negligence should operate on damages actually assessed. However, he noted that this was not the basis of the Court of Appeal’s decision and that s.3(3) of the 1953 Act was not directly applicable as it dealt with the limitation of liability pursuant to contract or written law (and not jurisdiction).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     The Court of Appeal’s analysis in the passage above assumes that the Court already has the <em>jurisdiction</em> to hear the case and discusses the <em>power</em> of the Court to reduce damages due to contributory negligence. However, the Deputy Registrar was seeking to answer a question about the <em>jurisdiction</em> of the District Court and correctly concluded that this discussion of <em>powers</em> did not assist him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     However, the third issue deals with how the District Court should exercise its <em>power</em> to reduce damages on account of contributory negligence rather than its <em>jurisdiction</em>. As such, I find that the Court of Appeal’s observation on contributory negligence supports the interpretation that contributory negligence operates on damages actually assessed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     Further support can be found in the High Court judgment in <em>Ng Chan Teng v Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 4 SLR(R) 0633.xml')">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 633</a> which arrived at the same result as the Court of Appeal without reference to the words “or otherwise.” I begin the analysis with an extract from paragraph 3 of Justice Choo Han Teck’s judgment:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">At that point, the amount of damages is not known. It might be less than the District Court statutory limit of $250,000 as stipulated by s 20 of the Subordinate Courts Act read with s 2 of the same, or it might be more. If it was less, the District Court would not only determine the quantum but also have the authority to order it to be paid. However, if the quantum assessed exceeded $250,000, the District Court would not have the <b>power</b> to order the full amount to be paid. Its order would be limited to the sum of $250,000. When a defendant consents to an interlocutory judgment at 70% liability (as in the present case) with damages to be assessed, he is taken to have accepted responsibility and bound to pay 70% of the damages that he would have to pay had he been found entirely liable (<em>ie</em>, 100%). It is <b>only after damages have been assessed that the court needs to know whether there are any other rules that prevent the plaintiff from fully recovering the amount assessed. It is then that s 20 of the Subordinate Courts Act applies, and the court cannot make an order that is more than $250,000 although the amount assessed was more.</b> (emphasis added)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     Justice Choo begins paragraph 3 of his judgment by saying that the sequence of proceedings is important. He discusses the <em>power</em> of the District Court to order a sum not exceeding the DC limit to be paid notwithstanding the fact that the amount assessed exceeded that amount. This paragraph suggests that the power is exercised at the <em>end</em> of the assessment of damages process. Given this sequence, it means that the Court should assess the damages first and reduce the assessed amount if contributory negligence is found or agreed upon. If the amount is still above the DC limit, s.22(1)(c) applies to limit the Court’s power in respect of the amount recoverable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     We can borrow the figures in <em>Keppel</em> to illustrate how this operates in a hypothetical case:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"/>(a)     Interlocutory judgment is entered with the defendant accepting 70% liability.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"/>(b)     Damages at 100% liability are quantified at $923,000. As the amount claimed exceeds the DC limit, the plaintiff must rely on either s.22 or s.23 of the Act in order for the District Court to have jurisdiction to hear an action where the amount claimed exceeds the DC limit.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"/>(c)     At 70% liability, this amounts to about $646,000. This amount represents the amount the plaintiff could recover if the Court’s jurisdiction had no limit.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_d"/>(d)     Having determined the amount potentially recoverable, we then consider the District Court’s powers to award damages. If section 22 applies, it can only make an award of up to $250,000 due to s.22(1)(c). On the other hand, if section 23 applies, there is no such restriction on the Court’s power to make an award in excess of $250,000</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     One practical implication of this approach is that plaintiffs may include in the Joint Opening Statement (“JOS”) for Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury Claims an amount claimed that exceeds the DC Limit. Re-quantification of the claim is not required though the Plaintiffs have to accept that the maximum amount recoverable is subject to the DC limit. This appears to be a practice adopted by plaintiffs in the State Courts. For example, this was done in <em>K Jeyakumar Naikar v Huationg Contractor Pte Ltd and another (supra).</em> Similarly, the Plaintiffs in the present case also filed a JOS that exceeded the DC limit though the Deputy Registrar ruled that they needed to re-quantify this amount.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed.
