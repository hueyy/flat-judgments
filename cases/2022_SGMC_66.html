Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"/>1       The Plaintiff has filed two suits against two separate defendants (“the Defendants”), in respect of statements uttered by the Defendants at a club meeting, which the Plaintiff claims were defamatory. The Defendants filed applications to strike out the Statement of Claim in both suits. At a Case Management Conference, the learned Deputy Registrar (“DR”) granted the applications. The Plaintiff filed appeals in each suit against the striking out of the Statements of Claim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       I have allowed the appeal and set aside the striking out orders. I have also allowed the Plaintiff to further particularise his pleadings by way of amendments to the Statements of Claim.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural Background</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       The Plaintiff is a member of both the Singapore Recreation Club (“SRC”) and SRC’s Billiards Section. He filed two suits in the Magistrates’ Courts against the Defendants, who were also SRC members, seeking damages for defamation. The Plaintiff alleged that at a meeting of the SRC Billiards Sub-Committee on 26 April 2021, each Defendant uttered defamatory remarks against the Plaintiff:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"/>(a)     In MC/MC 3607/2022 (“MC 3607”), the Plaintiff alleged that the defendant Sean Kerwin Mathews said, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Plaintiff “<em>has no respect for anyone</em>”, was “<em>too much</em>” and “<em>plays… as if he is damned good like that</em>”. The Plaintiff claimed that the natural and ordinary meaning of these words were understood to mean that he lacked respect for and was a nuisance to his fellow members in the Billiards Section and that he tended to belittle them.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"/>(b)     In MC/MC 3614/2022 (“MC 3614”), the Plaintiff alleged that the defendant Albert Teo Heng Kiat said, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Plaintiff was “<em>very rebellious</em>” and that “<em>we should really send him a signal</em>”. The Plaintiff claimed that the natural and ordinary meaning of these words were understood to mean, <em>inter alia</em>, that he was disrespectful and failed to comply with the rules.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       Furthermore, paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim in both suits pleaded that the relevant statements in both suits, by way of <b><em>innuendo</em></b>, meant or were understood to mean that, <em>inter alia</em>, the Plaintiff’s conduct was so lacking that he ought to have been expelled from the Billiards Section.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       The Plaintiff claimed that the utterances injured his reputation and caused him to suffer financial loss. Specifically, the Statement of Claim in both suits pleaded that because of the allegedly defamatory statements:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"/>(a)     the members at the meeting (at which the statements were uttered) unanimously voted to expel the Plaintiff from membership of the Billiards Section, with effect from 1 June 2021.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"/>(b)     A letter on SRC’s letterhead was subsequently sent to SRC’s Games Control Board Chairman, as well as members of SRC’s Sports &amp; Recreation Department, informing them that the Billiards Section Sub-Committee had reviewed the Plaintiff’s conduct and decided to discharge him as a member.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       By way of background, the Plaintiff was re-instated as a member of the Billiards Section on 3 August 2021, meaning that his expulsion lasted for a duration of two months.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       The Defendants each raised various defences, including justification, fair comment, and qualified privilege. They also filed counterclaims in respect of certain WhatsApp messages sent by the Plaintiff, claiming that these messages incorrectly suggested that the Defendants conspired to wrongfully expel him.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       The Defendants filed the applications in MC/SUM 3009/2022 (in DC 3607) and MC/SUM 3010/2022 (in DC 3614), praying for the court to strike out:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"/>(a)     the entire Statement of Claim in each suit; or alternatively</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"/>(b)     paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim (which pleaded the innuendo referred to in paragraph 4 above) in each suit.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       Before the learned DR below, the Defendants argued (in summary) that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"/>(a)     The entire Statement of Claim in both suits should be struck out because the cause of action was one for slander, which requires special damage in order to be actionable, but the Plaintiff failed to plead any such damage.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"/>(b)     Paragraph 6 of the Statements of Claim (which alleged that the statements uttered by the Defendants were defamatory by way of innuendo) should be struck out because an innuendo requires the listener to have knowledge of extrinsic facts that cause the uttered words to convey a defamatory imputation, but the Plaintiff failed to plead any such facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     The learned DR below noted that the alleged slander in this case was not actionable <em>per se</em> and that special damage was needed to sustain the action. He held that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate the existence of any special damage and, on that basis, struck out the Statement of Claim in both suits. In light of this, he did not rule on the Defendants’ alternative prayer to strike out paragraph 6 of the Statements of Claim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     The Plaintiff appeals against the striking out orders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     I set aside the orders striking out the Statement of Claim in both suits and instead allow the Plaintiff to amend his pleadings to provide further particulars of his claim.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant limb for striking out</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     Preliminarily, I observe that the in their striking out application, the Defendants failed to properly identify the legal basis for striking out. The summonses to strike out each list <em>all four limbs</em> of O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court as the bases of the prayers. Specifically, prayers 1 and 2 of both summonses ask that the pleadings be struck out on grounds that they:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"/>(a)     disclose no reasonable cause of action,</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"/>(b)     are frivolous or vexatious,</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"/>(c)     may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action, and/or</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"/>(d)     are otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     As for the Defendants’ submissions, these are equally unhelpful as they fail to properly explain which limb they are relying on. Before the learned DR, the Defendants cited the case of <em>Bank of China Ltd, Singapore Branch v BP Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2021] 5 SLR 747, which was a High Court decision focusing on limb (a) of O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court (<em>ie</em>, striking out on grounds of the pleadings disclosing no reasonable cause of action – see [21] of the High Court’s decision).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     Yet, the Defendants’ submissions have not explicitly stated that they are relying on limb (a). In fact, the Defendants have adduced affidavit evidence to establish their principal argument that the Plaintiff suffered no special damage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Given that O 18 r 19(2) of the Rules of Court states that no evidence shall be admissible on an application to strike out under limb (a) of O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court, any reliance by the Defendants on limb (a) would have been problematic. As for limbs (c) and (d), a perusal of the Defendants’ submissions fails to disclose any arguments to the effect that the Plaintiff’s pleadings prejudiced, embarrassed or delayed a fair trial, or that they were an abuse of process of the court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     As such, based on the materials before me, the most relevant limb of O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court that seems to be at play here is limb (b), <em>ie</em>, that the Plaintiff’s claim was frivolous or vexatious. A claim is “frivolous or vexatious” when it is obviously unsustainable: see <em>Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/9595-SSP-M.xml')">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582</a> (at [37]). In <em>The “Bunga Melati 5”</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0546.xml')">[2012] 4 SLR 546</a>, the Court of Appeal explained (at [39]) that an action is plainly unsustainable if it is either:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"/>(a)     legally unsustainable, <em>ie</em>, it is clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove, he will still not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks; or</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"/>(b)     factually unsustainable, <em>ie</em>, it is possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance (<em>eg</em>, if it is clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>The Defendants’ submissions do not assert that the Plaintiff’s claims were factually unsustainable or controverted by the surrounding evidence. It is thus apparent that if the orders for striking out are to be sustained at all, the most apposite ground would be that the Statements of Claim were <b>legally unsustainable</b>. The learned DR below appeared to proceed on this basis in striking out the Statements of Claim in both suits, when he observed that slander requires proof of special damage, but no special damage is discernible in this case.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The need to plead special damage in an action for slander</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     In an action for slander, the common law rule is that special damage must be proven, unless one of the exceptions in the Defamation Act applies: see <em>Yan Jun v Attorney-General</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16710-SSP-M.xml')">[2014] SGCA 60</a> (at [109]).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     Furthermore, the Plaintiff must expressly <b><em>plead</em></b> what that special damage is. Specifically, O 78 r 3(3A) of the Rules of Court states:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Without prejudice to Order 18, Rule 12, the plaintiff must give full particulars in the statement of claim of the facts and matters on which he relies in support of his claim for damages, including details of any conduct by the defendant which it is alleged has increased the loss suffered and of any loss which is peculiar to the plaintiff’s own circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     The Plaintiff contends that the learned DR erred in finding that no special damage could be discerned from the Statements of Claim. The Plaintiff argues that the temporal loss of his membership in the Billiards Section is, in and of itself, a recognised category of special damage. In support of this, the Plaintiff relies on the English Court of Appeal decision in <em>Chamberlain v Boyd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/English/37841-E-M.xml')">(1882) 11 QBD 407</a>, where Bowen LJ remarked (at p 415):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Possibly the membership of a club <b><em>may be a matter of temporal advantage</em></b>, and the deprivation of it may be an injury or damage of which the law will take cognisance. [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>It should be highlighted that the above pronouncement was by way of <em>dicta</em> – Bowen LJ ultimately allowed the demurrer against the plaintiff, holding (at p 415) that the slander complained of did not <em>cause</em> the alleged damage. Furthermore, the two other members of the coram, Lord Coleridge CJ (at p 412) and Brett LJ (at p 413), each opined that the alleged damage concerned was too “shadowy” to be actionable.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     The Plaintiff nevertheless maintains that temporal loss of a club membership <em>can</em> constitute actionable damage and cites the case of <em>Kay Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/58488-M.xml')">[2008] SGHC 143</a> as an example where the court was able to assess such a loss in monetary terms. Extrapolating the Plaintiff’s argument, if the temporal loss of membership <em>in a club</em> can constitute special damage, the same can also be said of a temporal loss of membership in a <em>section of a club</em> (such as the Billiards Section).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21      <b>At this interlocutory juncture</b>, I am willing to give the Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and not rule out the possibility that loss of membership in a club (or section of a club) can constitute special damage, if there is evidence to this effect. Having said that, even if the temporal loss of membership in the Billiards Section can constitute special damage, the Plaintiff’s Statements of Claim still fail to adequately <em>particularise</em> that special damage. In his submissions, the Plaintiff refers to paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Statements of Claim, which recount how the Plaintiff was expelled from the Billiards Section and argues that this constitutes sufficient particularisation of special damage. In my view, this falls woefully short of what is required. The Plaintiff’s pleadings must still provide the necessary particulars to show how the temporal loss of membership translated into <b><em>pecuniary</em></b> terms. In <em>Workers' Party v Tay Boon Too</em> [1974-1976] SLR(R) 204 (“<em>Workers' Party</em>”), F A Chua J explained (at [34]) that special damage in an action for slander constitutes either:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"/>(a)     actual <b><em>pecuniary</em></b> loss; or</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"/>(b)     damage capable of <b><em>pecuniary</em></b> assessment.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>In arriving at this holding, Chua J relied on the following guidance from <em>Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander</em> (7<sup>th</sup> Ed), at paragraph 203:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Special damage is some ‘actual temporal loss’ — the loss of some ‘material’ or ‘temporal advantage’ which is <b><em>‘pecuniary’ or ‘capable of being estimated in money’</em></b>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     It is thus not enough for the Statement of Claim to blandly state that the Plaintiff’s expulsion in and of itself constitutes special damage, without alluding to the <em>scope of that damage, in terms of how it materialised by way of pecuniary impact</em>. This was particularly so on the facts of the present case where, based on the pleadings that have been filed, it is difficult to perceive what the pecuniary impact (if any) is. Specifically:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"/>(a)     the Plaintiff was expelled from of the Billiards Section for a very short duration of only two months, before he was re-instated; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"/>(b)     the Defendants have deposed on affidavit that the Plaintiff retained <b>full use</b> of SRC’s facilities, <em>including its billiard facilities</em>, even during the period of expulsion<sup>2 </sup>(this was not contradicted by Plaintiff Counsel).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     In my view, the nature of the present actions are such that if the Defendants are to have adequate notice of what the claims are about, the Plaintiff must plead the <em>estimated dollar value</em> of the alleged special damage (as was done by the plaintiffs in the <em>Workers' Party</em> case). Given that the facts currently within the court’s cognisance give no insight into how the fact of expulsion resulted in pecuniary consequences, such a dollar figure would help cast light not only on the size of the special damage, but more importantly its scope. I thus share the view of the learned DR below that the Statement of Claim in both suits is sorely lacking in this respect.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     Be that as it may, I do not think that the want of particularity in the Plaintiff’s pleadings is sufficient to warrant striking out the entire Statement of Claim. Even a serious want of particularity may not justify striking out (on the ground of there being no reasonable cause of action) if the pleadings can be remedied by an order that they be amended to incorporate the necessary particulars: see the decision of AR Justin Yeo in <em>Total English Learning Global Pte Ltd &amp; anor v Kids Counsel Pte Ltd</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHCR 0022.xml')">[2013] SGHCR 22</a> (at [43]), where a defective Statement of Claim was remedied by ordering the plaintiff to incorporate further particulars into the pleadings. In making this order, AR Yeo relied on the English decision of <em>British Airways Pension Trustees Ltd v Sir Robert McAlpine</em> 72 BLR 26 (“<em>British Airways Pension Trustees</em>”), where Saville LJ held:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">… this is again not a case in which it could be said that the Plaintiffs' claims were fundamentally flawed, in the sense that no further particulars could assist their cause, nor a case where … there had been an express refusal to provide further particulars or a contumelious disregard of court Orders.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">For these reasons it seems to me that the default of the Plaintiffs, serious though it was, fell far short of calling for the draconian remedy of striking them out, which of course would have meant that through limitation their claims would have gone for ever.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     At the hearing of the appeal on 17 October 2022, I raised the option of an amendment to Plaintiff Counsel. Initially, Plaintiff Counsel was resistant, insisting that the quantum of special damages was something better left for assessment of damages. However, he subsequently agreed that the Plaintiff could explore amending the Statements of Claim to insert an <em>estimate</em> of the dollar value of the special damage, as well as an explanation of that estimate. I had thus fixed a return date on 27 October 2022, for parties to come back to me with the proposed amendments to the Statements of Claim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     Unfortunately, when parties returned on 27 October 2022, the Plaintiff did an about turn and refused to provide an estimate of the special damage value. Instead, the Plaintiff sought to amend paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim in both suits to add the following paragraphs, which he claimed would sufficiently particularise the special damage:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">i)    The Plaintiff joined the SRC in or around 2013 and purchased a (transferrable) Ordinary Membership for S$7,000.00 or thereabouts.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">ii)    Thereafter, the Plaintiff (as a member of the SRC) joined the SRC Billiards section in or around 2013.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">iii)  As a member of the SRC, <b><em>the Plaintiff was entitled to the bundle of rights and privileges associated therewith, including but not limited to his right to partake in the various section activities and other sections in the SRC including the SRC Billiards section (which activities included inter alia participation in inter-club tournaments in Singapore and overseas, charity drives and other functions)</em></b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">iv)    From 1st June 2021 to 3rd August 2021, <b><em>the Plaintiff was deprived of his rights and privileges as a member of the SRC Billiards section</em></b> flowing from the utterance of the Words, which were a subset of his rights and privileges as an ordinary member of the SRC (and having purchased his Ordinary Membership of the SRC as aforesaid).</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">,,,    By reason of the above, the Plaintiff suffered special damage arising from the utterance of the Words.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     In my view, this does little to cast any light on what the special damage is. The proposed additions merely elaborate that when the Plaintiff was expelled, he lost a bundle of privileges, including the right to compete and participate in charity drives. However, this still leaves the reader none the wiser as to how that bundle of privileges translates into pecuniary terms.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     Plaintiff Counsel’s initial contention that the quantum of damages is better reserved for assessment of damages is wholly misconceived. This is not a case where the trial has been bifurcated, with the issue of liability being decided first and the quantum of damages being left for assessment at a later tranche. This is a simple defamation suit in the Magistrates’ Courts, where both liability and quantum are to be dealt with at one go.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     At the return date on 27 October 2022, Plaintiff Counsel maintained that the Plaintiff is under no obligation to state the dollar value of his claim, and only needs to give a general statement of special damages. He referred to <em>McGregor on Damages (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th ed)</em> (“<em>McGregor</em>”), where the learned authors stated (at paragraph 1887):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where, however, <b><em>the facts do not admit of particularising</em></b> specific<b><em> instances of loss</em></b>, then the courts are prepared to accept a <b><em>generalised statement of special damage</em></b> in pleading and general evidence of special damage in proof</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>However, the Plaintiff offered no explanation for why the facts of this case “do not admit of particularising specific instances of loss”. This is not a case where the size and nature of the special damage is something lying outside the remit of the Plaintiff’s knowledge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     In fact, if one looks at the very next section of the text in <em>McGregor</em>, it gives an example of an instance where particularising the special damage might be exempted:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is particularly so where the slander is followed by general falling off of business and the plaintiff’s customers are a fluctuating body <b><em>whose names are unknown to him</em></b>, as with the clientele of many shops or with the audiences of theatres.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>That illustration is far removed from the facts of the case before me. The Plaintiff would be fully aware of the circumstances surrounding his expulsion and its monetary consequences (if any).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     The present case is unlike personal injury suits where the quantum of special damage is complex and can only be ascertained with the aid of medical and actuarial expertise. Rather, what the Plaintiff has lost (in pecuniary terms) from his expulsion is something <b>entirely within his knowledge, and </b><b><em>his alone</em></b>. It is thus difficult to comprehend the Plaintiff’s coyness in not wanting to state upfront what the quantum of his special damage is. Such deliberate vagueness is antithetical to the very <em>raison d’être</em> of pleadings, which is to clearly set out the parameters of the claim and defence, thereby avoiding surprise and litigation by ambush.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     I had thus intimated to Plaintiff Counsel, at the return date on 27 October 2022, that I was minded to <b>order</b> the Plaintiff to file an amended Statement of Claim in both suits to:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"/>(a)     Set out an estimate of the quantum of the special damage; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"/>(b)     Explain, in general terms, how that estimate was derived, to illustrate how the Plaintiff's expulsion from the Billiards Section translated into pecuniary loss.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>I had then adjourned the appeal to a date for release of my verdict.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The fresh summonses </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     The Plaintiff has now filed two fresh summonses to amend the Statement of Claim to, <em>inter alia</em>, include not only the particulars at paragraph 26 above but also a further paragraph to quantify the additional damage at S$4,650:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">v)    At the material time (i.e. June 2021 and July 2021), the average sale price of an SRC ordinary membership was about S$4,650.00 or thereabouts as stated in the SRC Annual Report 2021, and as such the Plaintiff by being deprived of his rights and privileges as a member of the SRC Billiards section flowing from the utterance of the Words suffered a diminution in his rights and privileges as an SRC member and correspondingly a diminution in the value of his SRC membership – i.e. special damage to the extent of S$4,650.00 in value and/or to be assessed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     Given that this paragraph now explicitly quantifies the Plaintiff’s claim for special damages, as well as purports to explain its basis, I will allow the proposed amendments to include the paragraph, as well as the additional particulars at paragraph 26 above.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     The particularisation achieved by these amendments merely serves to set the stage for the case to be taken forward, whether to trial or for the Defendant to take out the relevant application in respect of the Statement of Claim (with the requisite affidavit evidence, if need be), now that the scope of special damage has been narrowed down with the necessary particulars and its basis explained within the pleadings.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     For completeness, I should add that the fresh summonses also seek to amend the Statements of Claim to add the <b><em>alternative claim</em></b> that the Plaintiff’s position as a member of the Billiards Section was an “office of honour”, and that the Defendants' utterances defamed him in the way of that office. By this amendment, the Plaintiff seeks to rely on s 5 of the Defamation Act for the proposition that he is <em>exempted</em> from having to prove special damage. Specifically, s 5 states:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">In an action for slander in respect of words calculated to <b><em>disparage the plaintiff in any office</em></b>, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of the publication, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage whether or not the words are spoken of the plaintiff <b><em>in the way of his office</em></b>, profession, calling, trade or business [emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>Defence Counsel has intimated that he will be resisting this amendment. I have thus given the Defendants timelines for filing their reply affidavits contesting the Plaintiff’s prayer to amend the Statement of Claim to include the “office of honour” point.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">The alternative prayer to strike out paragraph 6 of the Statements of Claim</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     The learned DR below did not deal with the alternative prayer sought by the Defendants, <em>ie</em>, striking out paragraph 6 of the Statements of Claim −there was no need for him to do so, as he had granted the Defendants’ primary prayer of striking out the entire Statements of Claim. Given that I have set aside the orders striking out the Statements of Claim, I now deal with this alternative prayer.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     In <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei &amp; anor</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004.xml')">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004</a>, the High Court explained (at [106]) that to establish an innuendo, the Plaintiff has the burden of proving that:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"/>(a)     there are facts extrinsic to the words which give those words a defamatory imputation;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"/>(b)     these facts were known to one or more of the persons to whom the words were published; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"/>(c)     knowledge of these extrinsic facts could cause the words to convey the defamatory imputation (on which the plaintiff relies) to a reasonable person possessing knowledge of those extrinsic facts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     I agree with the Defendants’ submission that the Statements of Claim, as currently drafted, fail to plead the extrinsic facts giving the Defendants’ utterances the allegedly defamatory imputation. The Plaintiff maintains<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> that he has properly particularised the extrinsic facts by way of paragraph 7 of the Statements of Claim, which alludes to the following particulars:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"/>(a)     After the utterance of the defamatory statements and the Plaintiff’s expulsion from the SRC Billiards Section, a letter was published stating that the Plaintiff had been discharged from the Section; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"/>(b)     The recipients of that letter would think that the Plaintiff’s conduct was so lacking that he ought to have been expelled.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>However, these particulars relate to the <em>aftermath</em>, which the Plaintiff claimed flowed from the utterances. They do not in any way allude to any extrinsic facts known to the audience when the allegedly defamatory words were uttered.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     Plaintiff Counsel contends that no extrinsic facts are needed, as the words could still be defamatory by way of innuendo if they are defamatory “by inference”. This contention was based on a plain misapprehension of the law. I can do no better than to refer to the decision of Ang Cheng Hock J in <em>Yeow Khim Seng Mark v Phan Ying Sheng</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26152-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGHC 145</a> (at [41]-[42]):</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    … I was not persuaded that the fourth set of statements constituted an innuendo. Even in its pleadings and submissions at first instance, the respondent’s arguments in relation to innuendo failed to identify any pertinent extrinsic facts. For instance, in its closing submissions at first instance, the respondent suggested that:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-2">By way of innuendo, the 4th Defamatory Statement as a whole suggests that there are many other capable people Samsung could have engaged “who can show you what dirt biking means”. This implies that the Plaintiff is not a capable and competent dirt biker, and that Samsung had erred by engaging the Plaintiff instead of others who are better riders and can better represent the biking community and/or Samsung.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    The reasoning here does not refer to any extrinsic facts; instead, it is solely and inescapably rooted in the words of the fourth set of statements themselves. <b><em>It is an inference from the words published, which is often described as a “false innuendo”. That argument is ultimately no different from one based on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used, because such would include inferential meanings. The respondent did not draw my attention to any extrinsic facts at the hearing before me either. In my view, without identifying any such extrinsic facts, the argument that the fourth set of statements was defamatory by innuendo fails at the first hurdle</em></b>.</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     Hence, to the extent that the Statements of Claim seek to plead a defamatory innuendo, they are wanting in particulars as they fail to set out what the relevant extrinsic facts are. However, I decline to strike out paragraph 6 of the Statements of Claim, bearing in mind the alternative to striking out that was canvassed in <em>British Airways Pension Trustees</em> (alluded to at paragraph 24 above). Instead, I order the Plaintiff to file an amended Statement of Claim in each suit to state the extrinsic facts known to the audience at the meeting when the Defendants’ utterances were made. I also give the Plaintiff the alternative option of amending paragraph 6 of the Statements of Claim to delete the reference to innuendo altogether and rely instead on the position which Plaintiff Counsel has taken at the appeals before me, <em>ie</em>, that the words are defamatory by inference.
