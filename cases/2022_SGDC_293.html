<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"/>1       Whenever offenders who have been convicted of using criminal force against or for voluntarily causing hurt to public servants (especially uniformed enforcement personnel) are sentenced by our Courts, their infractions are usually met with deterrent sentences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       There is good reason for this firm stand taken by our Courts. As stated by See Kee Oon J in <em>Aw Soy Tee v PP</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24612-SSP.xml')">[2020] SGHC 114</a> at [79], “…(it) is of vital importance to ensure that police and other officers who are at the frontline of law enforcement are adequately protected in the exercise of their duties. These officers frequently deal with unreasonable and uncooperative individuals and are often at the receiving end of verbal abuse and resistance, as well as retaliatory acts of force and aggression. … such conduct can lead to serious undesirable consequences at the societal level if left unchecked.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       The sentencing norms for such offenders (whose victims are enforcement officers) are very clear. Enforcement officers have to be protected from the dangers that their frontline work routinely makes them face. However, there are rare instances where the offender himself is an enforcement officer, causing hurt to a member of the public. How should such cases be dealt with? The offender in the present case is one such enforcement officer.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"/>4       Muhammad Alif Bin Jamaludin (“Alif”) was, at the material time, an Immigration Officer holding the rank of SGT1 and was employed by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”). As at the date of the offences, Alif had been in the employ of ICA for more than three years.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"/>5       The offences for which Alif pleaded guilty, occurred on 21 December 2018. Alif was 26 years of age at the time of the offences. The victim in this case, one Ramayah Chokkalingam (the “Victim’) was a 51 year old lorry driver. The Prosecution characterised the Victim as being a “defenceless member of the public”. The narration of the facts of this case from the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) confirms the accuracy of the Prosecution’s description of the Victim. The Prosecution also correctly pointed out that the Victim was almost twice the age of Alif on the date of the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"/>6       The matter was originally fixed for trial before me. Instead of proceeding with the trial, Alif decided to accept the Prosecution’s offer and pleaded guilty before me to two charges, with another charge to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"/>7       This was a particularly egregious case where an enforcement officer went wholly out of his permissible sphere of authority and severely beat up his victim and also used insulting words. Alif’s acts against the Victim were wholly disproportionate to what he perceived the Victim had done to him. These acts were indeed, shocking episodes of violence, carried out in public. This offence called for the imposition of a deterrent sentence against Alif.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"/>8       After hearing the submissions on sentence from the Prosecution and the Defence, I imposed a deterrent sentence on Alif, though not of the quantum sought by the Prosecution. Alif appealed against the (imprisonment) sentence meted out and is currently on bail pending appeal.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"/>9       One of the charges to which Alif pleaded guilty was for using insulting words against the Victim during the incident. Alif had used the Malay words “<em>puki mak”</em> (which mean “mother’s cunt” in English) on the Victim, with the intent to cause distress to the Victim. Distress was caused to the Victim. This was an offence under s 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act. For this charge, I imposed a fine of $2,000 on Alif. The Defence indicated that the appeal was not against this fine, but the imprisonment term imposed as set out in the paragraphs that follow. This fine was paid.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"/>10     The other proceeded charge was for voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim, under s 323 of the Penal Code. This charge (the “Proceeded 323 Charge”) described that Alif had grabbed the Victim by the Victim’s neck and had slammed the Victim into the side of lorry a few times, had used his (Alif’s) right shoulder to slam into the Victim’s back with force, and had hit the back of the Victim’s neck with force a few times. The Victim suffered bodily pain: head injury and contusion as a result of Alif’s acts.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"/>11     The TIC charge was also for voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim, under s 323 of the Penal Code. This charge (the “TIC 323 Charge”) recited that Alif had voluntarily caused hurt to the Victim by means of a baton measuring approximately 52 cm in length when fully extended, <em>to wit</em>, by hitting the Victim a few times with the extended baton, with the intention of causing, and did cause the Victim to suffer bodily pain.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"/>12     The SOF was read to Alif who admitted to the same without qualification. Two sets of video footage were also played in Court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     The SOF recited (as set out in [4] above) that Alif was an Immigration Officer (holding the rank of SGT1) and had been employed by ICA in that capacity for more than three years. The Victim, 51 years of age, was a lorry driver. Where applicable, I shall be quoting <em>verbatim</em> from the SOF.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"/>14     On 21 December 2018, Alif was on traffic control duty at the junction of Woodlands Road and Woodlands Crossing, near Woodlands Checkpoint. One Muhammad Rais Bin Amir (another Immigration Officer) (the “Witness”) was Alif’s partner for their duty on that day.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     The Victim was driving a 40-foot lorry (the “lorry”) along Woodlands Crossing towards Woodlands Checkpoint. The Victim arrived at the junction of Woodlands Road and Woodlands Crossing and was occupying the rightmost lane.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     Alif stopped the Victim’s lorry and directed the Victim to make a left turn instead onto Woodlands Road towards Kranji, where the Victim was supposed to make a U-turn and thereafter join the queue of heavy vehicles going towards Old Woodlands Checkpoint to clear customs.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     The Victim complied with Alif’s directions and proceeded to make a left turn in the lorry. In the process of executing the left turn, Alif perceived that the Victim had driven too close to him (Alif). Alif was enraged by this and threw his whistle at the lorry. The whistle hit the side door of the lorry. Alif told the Victim to stop the lorry along Woodlands Road, and that he would meet the Victim there. The Victim complied.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"/>18     After stopping the lorry along Woodlands Road, the Victim waited for Alif. Alif had left his post at the traffic junction and had followed the lorry. Thinking that Alif wanted to check his passport, the Victim alighted from the lorry to speak with Alif.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"/>19     Alif went up to the Victim and grabbed the Victim by his (Victim’s) neck. Alif slammed the Victim into the side of the lorry a few times. Alif also used his right shoulder to slam into the Victim’s back with force, and hit the back of the Victim’s neck with force a few times.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"/>20     Alif carried on his assault on the Victim. In the course of this assault, Alif drew his service-issued short extendable baton and extended it fully.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"/>21     Sometime during the assault, the Witness, who was still at the traffic junction, was alerted by some drivers that an ICA officer was beating up a driver. The Witness quickly put down traffic cones to stop traffic and proceeded to the scene of the assault.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"/>22     The Witness arrived at the scene and told Alif to stop. Despite this, Alif persisted in his assault of the Victim. As observed by the Witness, Alif held the extended short extendable baton, as if he was preparing to hit the Victim. Alif also made kicking motions towards the Victim. According to Alif, these acts (observed by the Witness) were done with the intention of scaring the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"/>23     A portion of the assault was filmed by a member of the public and the video was uploaded onto social media where it was widely shared.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"/>24     Alif stopped his assault eventually and allowed the Victim to leave the scene. Alif did not report the incident to his superiors at ICA. It was instead, the video footage circulated online which caught the attention of ICA. Alif was eventually identified and questioned.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"/>25     As a result of Alif’s attack on the Victim, the Victim was sent for medical examination. The Victim was found to have head injury and contusions secondary to assault. There was parietal region pain and right lateral neck and right flank tenderness. A medical report was tendered to Court.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"/>26     During the assault, Alif had also insulted the Victim by uttering the Malay words “<em>puki mak</em>” (translated into English as “mother’s cunt”). The Victim understood what Alif had said in Malay. Alif had uttered these insulting words with the intent of causing distress to the Victim. Distress was caused to the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"/>27     Alif was thus convicted of the two proceeded charges on his plea of guilt. The TIC 323 Charge had also to be carefully considered when it came to deciding on the appropriate sentence to be meted out to Alif, especially in relation to the Proceeded 323 Charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"/>28     I carefully considered the respective positions on sentence put forth by the Prosecution and the Defence. The aggravating factors in this case weighed very heavily against Alif. I carefully considered the personal circumstances raised in the Mitigation and decided that they were not exceptional and did not raise sufficient basis for reducing the quantum of an indicative appropriate sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"/>29     For the Proceeded 323 Charge, the Prosecution was urging the Court to impose an imprisonment term of 7 months. The Defence submitted that a high fine would be appropriate, and if the Court was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed, then an imprisonment term of 4 weeks or at the maximum, a term of 2 months should be imposed.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"/>30     After a careful analysis of the circumstances, especially with regard to the harm caused and the culpability of Alif, I sentenced Alif to imprisonment for a term of 26 weeks for the Proceeded 323 Charge. As stated in [9], I imposed a fine of $2,000 for the other proceeded charge. The Defence does not appeal against this fine. Primarily the appeal would be against the imprisonment term imposed. The fine was paid.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"/>31     The Prosecution prefaced their submissions on sentence by stating that, “This is one of the most egregious cases of law enforcement brutality to have happened in Singapore.” The Prosecution also succinctly stated that Alif had “exacted an unmitigated assault on a defenceless member of the public almost twice his age.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"/>32     The Prosecution pointed out that the Victim had been “brutally beaten up and insulted by (Alif) in an assault that not only took place in broad daylight on a busy public road, but which was filmed by a member of the public and circulated on social media.” It was further pointed out that Alif “did not relent even after his colleague, (the Witness) arrived on the scene and told him to stop. To make matters worse, even after the incident, (Alif) did not report the matter to his superiors. ICA instead discovered the assault after the footage caught such online traction that his superiors were notified.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"/>33     The High Court in <em>Low Song Chye v PP and another appeal</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23956-SSP.xml')">[2019] 5 SLR 526</a> (“<em>Low Song Chye</em>”) set out the sentencing framework in cases of s 323 of the Penal Code to enable the sentencing court to arrive at the appropriate sentence to be meted out.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"/>34     See Kee Oon J set out the “two-step inquiry” framework at [78] of <em>Low Song Chye</em>, “(first), the court should identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence. This would allow the court to derive the appropriate indicative starting point.” and “(next), the court should make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as other relevant factors. <b>This may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range.</b>” (emphasis added).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"/>35     See Kee Oon J further stated in [78] of <em>Low Song Chye</em> that the aggravating and mitigating factors identified in the Court of Appeal decision in <em>PP v BDB</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21397-SSP.xml')">[2018] 1 SLR 127</a> (“<em>BDB</em>”) “are relevant at this (second) step.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"/>36     The sentencing framework prescribed in <em>Low Song Chye</em> is set out below:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.48%"/><col width="53.34%"/><col width="34.18%"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Band</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Hurt caused</b> </p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"> <b>Indicative sentencing range</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to four weeks</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p> </td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p> </td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p> </td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p> </td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’ imprisonment</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear="left"/><br clear="left"/> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     The Prosecution and the Defence were both of the view that with respect to the hurt caused to the Victim, this case fell to be considered in Band 1. The different approaches to the second stage of the two-step <em>Low Song Chye</em> inquiry produced the widely deviating final stands on sentence taken by the Prosecution and the Defence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"/>38     At [81] of <em>Low Song Chye</em>, the High Court stated that “… the indicative ranges provided are merely starting points. There may be cases in which minor harm is caused, but where the custodial threshold is crossed such that a sentence up to or even in excess of four weeks’ imprisonment may be warranted. This may be due to, for example, a particular need for deterrence resulting from … the need to protect a specific category of victim, or where there are factors indicating a high level of culpability, such as the use of a weapon, or a premeditated … attack.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     At [71] of <em>Low Song Chye</em>, the High Court, (in comparing the approach of the Court of Appeal in <em>BDB</em> with respect to cases involving s 325 of the Penal Code with their attendant more serious injuries), stated that, “Where less serious hurt is concerned, it may fairly be said that other factors, including those going towards culpability, may carry greater weight. To an extent, this is consistent with the approach taken by the courts thus far in setting out sentencing guidance in specific categories of s 323 offences identified on the basis of factors other than the severity of hurt. This includes offences against public transport workers … and domestic helpers ….”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"/>40     Thus, where in the case here where Alif had committed serious acts of violence against a member of the public clothed in the authority of an enforcement officer, there is great weight to the Prosecution’s argument that Alif’s culpability was “singularly <em>exceptional</em> and sufficient to merit … 7 months’ imprisonment” (italics in the original), which was a “substantial uplift in sentence”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     The Prosecution systematically set out the highly aggravating factors in this case. First, it was pointed out that Alif was a “uniformed officer of the law on duty at the time”. The Prosecution rightly asserted that the “commission of offences by a law enforcement officer must be met by a stiff sentence as they undermine public confidence in the agency.” The Prosecution further stressed that Alif “had abandoned his post and duty at a busy intersection in order to satisfy a personal vendetta against the (Victim). Quite apart from his dereliction of duty, (Alif’s) actions were a shocking breach of the confidence and trust placed on law enforcement officers, and abuse of his position of power.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     I agreed with the Prosecution’s characterisation of the severity of Alif’s acts. Law enforcement officers in Singapore enjoy a very high degree of respect and regard from the public, and for good reason too. By and large, law enforcement officers are seen to carry out their duties in public with fairness and a high level of integrity. These high degrees of impeccable performance of their public duties have earned law enforcement officers in Singapore a lofty level of respect from the public whom they serve.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     The actions of errant officers like Alif would have the effect of possibly reversing the high levels of trust and respect that the public holds. It would be a backward step in relations between the law enforcement agencies and the public, if members of the public are led to fear overreactions from officers or worse, the wanton committal of criminal acts by the officer, as had occurred in the current case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"/>44     Second, the Prosecution emphasised that Alif’s reaction to the Victim’s acts was wholly disproportionate. I would agree. Taken at its highest, even if the Victim had meant to cause fear in Alif by driving too close to him, or had actually intended to make contact with Alif with the lorry (there was no contact with the lorry), the reactions of Alif in resorting to violence were clearly beyond reason. If the Victim had driven with the intention of causing harm to Alif or to cause him fear, or had driven in an inconsiderate or dangerous manner, Alif, as a law enforcement officer would have been able to take the Victim to task. Instead, Alif chose to vent his anger at the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"/>45     Third, the Prosecution points to the fact that Alif had assaulted a “relatively vulnerable victim almost twice his age”. The narration in the SOF suggests that the Victim could not defend himself adequately.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"/>46     Fourth, the Prosecution opined that the “assault was brutal and of substantial length in time”. I would agree. There was simply no excuse for Alif to inflict on the Victim the various acts set out in the SOF. The cumulative effect of the various acts of violence does demonstrate the brutality of the attack on the Victim. The attack did span a considerable period of time. It commenced before the Witness was informed of the incident by the public, and was still in progress by the time the Witness reached the scene.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"/>47     Fifth, it was stressed that Alif “carried on his assault even after his colleague (the Witness) asked him to stop”. I agreed with the Prosecution that Alif’s “continued violence despite attempts to stop him only serves to signal how aggravated his culpability is.”</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"/>48     Sixth, the Prosecution stressed that the “offence took place in broad daylight along a busy public road, and was even filmed and uploaded online where it went viral”. This contrasted with some of the case precedents cited by the Prosecution where either the uniformed violence occurred out of the public view, or was visible for a far shorter period of time. That this offence had occurred in full view of the public was highly aggravating. That the uploaded video “went viral” expanded the scope of the public demonstration of these shameful and violent acts of a law enforcement officer.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"/>49     In <em>BDB</em>, the Court of Appeal set out at [62], some of the aggravating factors that a sentencing judge should consider in deciding an offender’s culpability. Amongst the factors listed, “the extent of deliberation or premeditation”, “the manner and duration of the attack” and “the victim’s vulnerability” have been mentioned above. The Court of Appeal also listed “the use of any weapon” as an aggravating factor.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     With regard “the use of any weapon”, the Prosecution alluded to Alif having drawn his service-issued short extendable baton and “extended it fully”, and “was seen by the (Witness) holding it as if he was preparing to hit the (Victim)” Alif had done this with the “intention of scaring the (Victim)”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     It has to be pointed out and clearly borne in mind what is recited in the TIC 323 Charge. In this TIC charge, it is clearly stated that Alif had voluntarily caused hurt to the Victim “by means of (the) baton”, by “hitting the (Victim) a few times with the extended baton, with the intention of thereby causing hurt to the (Victim)”. Quite clearly, Alif had not only intended to scare the Victim with the extended baton, he did actually hit the Victim “a few times” with the baton.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     Alif’s use of the baton in this manner was particularly egregious. He had wrongfully used a service-issued implement as a weapon in circumstances that certainly did not warrant its use. Alif was acting beyond the bounds of his duty when he drew the baton, and extended it, to “scare” and hit the Victim. It is trite law that whilst an offender would not be sentenced for a charge that is TIC, in these circumstances, the circumstances surrounding the facts recited in the TIC 323 Charge call squarely for an uplift in an indicative sentence for the Proceeded 323 Charge.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"/>53     The Prosecution cited three cases (all involving “police brutality”) in support of their call for a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution indicated that for the first case, the lower court’s sentence was upheld on appeal, but there did not appear to be any Judgment or Grounds of Decision of the appellate court. For the second case, it was indicated that the accused in that case withdrew the appeal against conviction and sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"/>54     We turn our attention to the third case, for which there was a reported High Court Judgment. In <em>Chua Yong Khiang Melvin v PP</em> [1999] 2 SLR (R) 1108 (“<em>Melvin Chua</em>”), Yong Pung How CJ dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence. The offender had been a police corporal on duty at the then Subordinate Courts lock-up. The victim there (the complainant) was a detainee in the lock-up at the material time.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"/>55     The offender in <em>Melvin Chua</em> had “punched the complainant twice in the stomach, picked him up and hurled him against a wall, picked him up again and threw him against a stone bench, and then twisted his arm behind his back”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"/>56     The district judge had sentenced the offender in <em>Melvin Chua</em> to imprisonment for a term of eight months. The Prosecution in our present case reminds us that the maximum imprisonment term operative at the time of the offence in <em>Melvin Chua</em> was one year. (At the time Alif committed the material offence here, the maximum imprisonment sentence that could be imposed was two years.)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"/>57     Yong Pung How CJ affirmed the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment meted out in <em>Melvin Chua</em>. Whilst there are differences between the fact scenarios in <em>Melvin Chua</em> and our present case, it was clear that where the offender was a law enforcement officer carrying out official duties and committed heinous acts of violence, a deterrent sentence of sufficient gravity had to be meted out. What has to be contrasted in our present case is Alif’s use of the baton and that the acts of violence were carried out in the public glare.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"/>58     The offender in <em>Melvin Chua</em> was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment (where the maximum imprisonment sentence then was one year). In the present case, the custodial threshold was clearly crossed, and Alif was liable to have been sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years. The Prosecution’s call for a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment for Alif, at first blush, would not appear to be excessive.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"/>59     In the Mitigation Plea, the Defence painted the prior acts of the Victim as amounting to dangerous driving. As stated earlier, even if the Victim was to be faulted for his manner of driving, there was legal recourse that Alif could have taken. Alif instead demonstrated thuggish, bullying behaviour against the Victim amounting to a vengeful outburst against the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"/>60     The Defence also suggested that the incident between Alif and the Victim had later been resolved between the parties. This misses the point. Any resolution between the parties could not “undo” the wrongful acts that Alif had committed in the sight of the public.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"/>61     The Defence also pointed out that the “police brutality” cases cited by the Prosecution were all pre-<em>Low Song Chye</em>. It had to be borne in mind that <em>Melvin Chua</em> was a High Court decision dealing with the wrongful, violent acts of a law enforcement officer.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"/>62     I carefully considered all the factors. The aggravating factors weighed very heavily against Alif. The personal family circumstances and other facts claimed as mitigating factors were, in my mind, insufficient to ground any appreciable discount of the sentence to be meted out. I bore in mind all the aggravating factors and took into account the facts recited in the TIC 323 Charge. I decided that, in the round, a sentence of 26 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for the Proceeded 323 Charge. Alif was sentenced accordingly.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"/>63     Before I sentenced Alif, I made the following brief oral remarks, delivered <em>ex tempore</em>.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"/>64     “Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Cheah and Mr. Lim very much for your respective submissions. They have been indeed very useful in this case in coming to the sentence which I will be shortly meting out. I’ll just make a few brief oral remarks before passing the sentence in this case. In the recent grounds of decision of a civilian who had used criminal force against a police officer, I laid emphasis on the need for the law to protect police officers from such acts, whether they be criminal force or causing hurt by members of the public. It was essential that protection of police officers was held paramount. The other side of the coin equally bears emphasis and the reason why we do not need to look at that often is because by and large, the law enforcement officers in Singapore are law-abiding, carry out their duties within reason and within their powers and with sufficient discretion. It is indeed rare to have cases where an enforcement officer exceeds the bounds of his or her duty, commits an offence and has to be punished by the law. In this particular case, I would tend to agree with the Prosecution that just because the accused is an ICA officer and not a police officer, that it should be seen in a lesser light. It was clear that the accused was wearing a uniform and was carrying out enforcement duties. As far as the general public are concerned, this was a person who had to be obeyed. He was empowered and entrusted with responsibilities by the law to carry out his duties and the public had to obey. Now, even if the victim had driven dangerously or in an inconsiderate manner, the response from the accused was definitely beyond what was reasonable in ordinary circumstances. I agree with the Prosecution that there would have been enough time after the accused had thrown a whistle at the vehicle for him to have cooled down, to have realised that by the colour of his uniform, he was entrusted and had powers to take the situation under lawful control. Instead, what he did resulted in the criminal acts for which he stands charged for and is to be sentenced. I was guided by the cases that the Prosecution had cited. I did bear in mind that these are cases involving police officers and I also bore in mind that for the second and third cases, they were---they had been committed without the public glare. And in the first one, the portion that occurred in public was for a shorter period of time. So, there was a balancing exercise required to come to the appropriate sentence. Whilst Low Song Chye is the authority that we have to look to, it would be clear to Prosecution and Defence that that guideline goes on the basis of the harm caused and this was to the degree of the hurt that was caused by the accused person in any particular matter to be considered. Clearly, culpability of an accused person plays a large part. As I said, this was a situation where in a very rare situation, a law enforcement officer literally took the law into his own hands, went beyond the bounds of his duty and reacted out of proportion to what the victim had done. As I said, if the victim had driven in an inconsiderate or even a dangerous manner, there was proper recourse that could be held against this victim. Even if the victim’s actions could amount to something intentional, there was no cause for the accused to have reacted in the way he did. The Court has to take this into account that what the accused did gravely brought the uniform into disrepute, this happened in public. Whilst I agree with Mr. Lim that we should not take to heart what is said on social media because quite obviously, very often, the full picture is not known. But what is clear to see is that this was a uniformed officer charged with law enforcement and whatever the scope is, he is entrusted with certain powers as I’ve stated earlier. What the accused did was indeed shocking. He was in a position to have taken control of the situation and he definitely did not need to react in the way he did. I have to bear in mind that what the situation shows is that his level of culpability was very high in this particular case and that has to be reflected in the sentence. A clear message has to be sent that the Courts will not tolerate any ill conduct that amounts to criminal---to a criminal offence by any member of the uniformed enforcement. Precisely because the uniform they wear provides them with that authority and engen---engenders the respect that is required from the public to show their office and to show the public that what they do has to be obeyed so long as it’s within reason and within law. So, when a uniformed person such as the accused commits an offence for which even if he was a civilian not in uniform would amount to an egregious event, the punishment to be meted out has to correspondingly cater to that to send that message that such acts are not to be tolerated. Mr. Muhammad Alif, please stand. You’ve been convicted on 2 charges, 1 other being taken into consideration and the Court has to take that into consideration in coming to the sentence to be imposed. You are sentenced as follows: For MAC 907899 of 2019, a charge under the Protection from Harassment Act, you are sentenced to a fine of $2,000, in default 1 week’s imprisonment. And for the charge under MAC 907898 of 2019, charge under Section 323 of the Penal Code, you are sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 26 weeks. Total sentence, imprisonment 26 weeks and fine $2,000, in default 1 week’s imprisonment. Sentence to commence today unless there’s further application.” (end of Oral Remarks)</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"/>65     In summary, this was a case that cried out for a deterrent sentence. Both the elements of specific and general deterrence were called into play. Alif had to learn that he had to control his emotions, whether in or out of uniform. As stated above, any perceived wrongful act of the Victim (through the Victim’s driving) could have and ought to have been properly reported through the proper channels. Instead, Alif resorted to shocking acts of violence against the Victim, carried out in public. The use of the baton was particularly egregious. Alif had used the baton to scare and to hit the Victim.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"/>66     The need for a harsh sentence was also necessary to satisfy the need for general deterrence. All law enforcement officers (whether uniformed or not) need to be reminded of the gravity of the duties imposed on them. That Singapore is well known for its low crime rate and impeccable sense of law and order came through years of determined discipline and strict governance. We should guard against this reputation being spoilt by wayward officers. Any act of violence carried out in a criminal fashion by a law enforcement officer is one such act too many. In many instances, the use of force by the law enforcement officer is necessary. In the present case, what Alif did was clearly beyond the pale. The violent acts were clearly totally disproportionate. A stern message must be sent to law enforcement officers that any similar criminal acts will be met with a necessarily severe sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"/>67     The element of retribution plays a part as well. Singapore is certainly not used to witnessing any form of law enforcement brutality. That such acts were committed in broad daylight and for a sufficient period that it could be captured on video, were deeply unsettling to say the least. The very occurrence of such acts would have sent a chilling effect through ordinary law-abiding citizens and residents; what more for those who had viewed the video. We must prevent the system of law enforcement from descending into an unacceptable situation where those in authority are feared for the wrong reasons.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"/>68     The Defence had tried to downplay the issue of Alif’s role in law enforcement. In commenting that the cases cited by the Prosecution all involved police officers, the Defence stated, “…Alif is not in the mould of a police officer. … He could only apprehend people within the checkpoint.”(at [51] of the Mitigation Plea). This misses the point totally. From this submission, it was still clear that Alif was clothed with authority over persons who came to be controlled under his demarcated sphere of law enforcement. Alif was armed, at least, with a baton, which when wrongly used as a weapon, could cause potentially great harm. Seen in this light, any case involving police brutality would be relevant, in considering the quantum of sentence to be meted out to errant law enforcement officers.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"/>69     It was clear that the sentencing bands set out in <em>Low Song Chye</em> were “merely starting points”, and that after considering the aggravating factors present in a case, adjustments necessary “to the indicative starting point sentence” “may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range”. Such instances of a sentence being outside of the indicative sentencing range include situations where there was a “need to protect a specific category of victim, or where there are factors indicating a high level of culpability, such as the use of a weapon”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"/>70     The High Court in <em>Low Song Chye</em> also stated that, “Where less serious hurt is concerned, it may fairly be said that other factors, including those going towards culpability, may carry greater weight. To an extent, this is consistent with the approach taken by the courts thus far in setting out sentencing guidance in specific categories of s 323 offences identified on the basis of factors other than the severity of hurt. This includes offences against public transport workers … and domestic helpers …”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"/>71     With regard to the sentencing for errant law enforcement officers, the High Court in <em>Melvin Chua</em> affirmed the sentence of eight months’ imprisonment meted out by the district judge. What is significant is that the maximum imprisonment sentence faced by the offender in <em>Melvin Chua</em> was one year, whereas Alif faced a maximum imprisonment sentence of two years (as s 323 then stood at the time of Alif’s offence).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"/>72     The sentence meted out to Alif, 26 weeks’ imprisonment, was within Band 2 of the <em>Low Song Chye</em> framework (one band above the indicative starting point). Upon a full consideration of all the aggravating and mitigating factors, and taking into consideration the TIC 323 Charge, it was an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"/>73     Commencement of the imprisonment sentence was stayed in view of the appeal. Alif is currently on bail pending appeal. The fine had been paid.</p> </div></content></root> </div> <form name="_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_fm" action="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1"> </form> <script>$(document).ready(function(){jQuery(".aui").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("aui")});linkElement=document.createElement("link");linkElement.rel="stylesheet";linkElement.href="/lawnet3-base-portlet/css/free-resources/content/Blobs1.css";document.head.appendChild(linkElement)});function viewPageContent(a){var b="https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage";b=b+"&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId="+a;window.open(b)}function actionFiltering(b,d){var a="/lawnet/group/lawnet/result-page?p_p_id=legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=submitCasesSg&_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_searchType=1";var c="_legalresearchresultpage_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_";grouping="1";category="1";window.open(a+"&"+c+"=actionFiltering&"+c+"topWhere="+b+"&"+c+"topterm="+d+"&"+c+"grouping="+grouping+"&"+c+"category="+category)};</script> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alert alert-info"> Node: l126paap4 </div> <form action="#" id="hrefFm" method="post" name="hrefFm"> <span></span> </form> </div> </div> <div id="footerContainer"> <div id="adbanner" > <!-- <iframe scrolling="no" alt="" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" frameborder="0" height="96" hspace="0" id="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" name="_48_INSTANCE_XUSeNR9xsMJm_iframe" src="" width="100%"> Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames.
