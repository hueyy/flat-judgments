Between September 2021 and April 2022, she committed a spate of offences. The offences included dishonestly obtaining dental services from four different clinics, and using threatening communications against the staff of the clinics when her request for a waiver of the fees was refused; using threatening communications and abusive words against other entities and individuals, including a cousin; and stealing valuables and cash from a neighbour’s home. 14 charges were brought against Ng for the offences.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"/>2       Ng was assigned a counsel under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS). A plead-guilty mention was fixed on 7 November 2022 for her to plead guilty. At the start of the plead-guilty proceedings on 7 November 2022, Ng’s assigned counsel applied to be discharged from further acting for Ng. Counsel informed that she had been unable to take instructions from Ng, and that CLAS was withdrawing legal aid and no other CLAS lawyer would be assigned. Ng was thus unrepresented at the plead-guilty mention. She pleaded guilty to six charges, and the remaining eight charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"/>3       Ng was sentenced to a total of 9 months and 6 weeks’ imprisonment.

Ng told Chan that Lim Hwee Li (“<b>Lim</b>”, who was a director of Illumia), was nice, kind and always did charity, and asked if Lim was kind enough to donate $500 to her. (Ng had apparently read from Google that Lim was a charitable person.) Ng also said that she was poor and had not changed her furniture for 20 years. She requested that Chan pass all the messages to Lim. Ng left her name as “Wong Mei Xin” with contact number XXX before ending the call.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"/>13     Shortly after, Ng called Illumia Wheelock’s landline repeatedly using the number XXX but Chan declined to answer the calls.

Chan refused and asked for assistance from her colleague, Low Jia Ling (“<b>Low</b>”), a service staff at Illumia Wheelock. Ng then spoke to Low and asked for Lim to give her $500. When Low advised Ng to seek financial assistance from a social worker, Ng replied that she was already receiving $300 a month but that was not enough. Ng said in Mandarin:</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“You’re not scared if I post that Kim Lim used expired products on customers, killing people and stab until blood all come out, first people to jump off building.”</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">and</p> <p class="Judg-Quote-1">“You’re not scared that I use a bomb to bomb your clinic”.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"/>15     A staff of Illumia Wheelock alerted the police. Upon realising that the police were on their way, Ng kept repeating the words in Mandarin and English as she walked away. Awhile later, Ng returned and showed Chan the WhatsApp message that she sent to Illumia Wheelock’s WhatsApp number. She said to Chan, “You’re really not scared if I post this and I only want S$500”. When Chan replied that the police were on their way, Ng left (and did not return again that day).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"/>16     From 16 September 2021 to 3 October 2021, Ng used nine different mobile numbers to call Illumia Wheelock’s landline repeatedly, calling Lim names and threatening to defame Lim and Illumia. As Chan could not tell if the numbers belonged to a genuine customer or Ng, Chan answered the calls. As a result, Illumia Wheelock’s customers complained about their landline always being engaged.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"/>17     During that period, Ng also used the same nine different mobile numbers to send numerous WhatsApp messages to Illumia Wheelock’s WhatsApp number. Chan read the messages and saw that they contained screenshots of various social media accounts belonging to local celebrities, threats to defame Lim and Illumia, and vulgar language.

The letter placed her on notice that she was banned from entry into all of the premises occupied, leased, or owned by the Companies, and that her presence at any of the Companies’ premises would amount to an act of trespass.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"/>37     On 12 March 2022, at about 1.33 pm, Ng went to Illumia Wheelock (referred to at [12]-[18] above). Ng approached Low, who was seated at the front desk counter, and asked to speak to Lim in order to ask Lim for money. Low informed Ng that she was not allowed entry at Illumia Wheelock and that the police would be called if Ng refused to leave. Ng left but, shortly after, with the intent to annoy Low, Ng returned and headed straight to the rear end of the clinic to look for Lim.

Ng would sometimes go to Ang’s unit to chat with him. In the course of visiting Ang, Ng came to know that he would usually place his valuables inside the top drawer of a small cabinet in his living room, secure the drawer with a key, and place the key on top of the cabinet.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"/>39     On 1 April 2022, at about 7 am, Ng visited Ang at his unit to spend time together. At about 1 pm, Ang went to the toilet. While Ang was in the toilet, Ng took some items from the top drawer of the small cabinet in Ang’s living room without Ang’s consent. The items were:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"/>(a)     one black ‘Crossing’ wallet valued at $200;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"/>(b)     one Singapore identity card belonging to Ang;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"/>(c)     one Singapore driving licence belonging to Ang;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"/>(d)     one POSB ATM card belonging to Ang;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_e"/>(e)     cash amounting to $200;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_f"/>(f)     one red packet containing cash of $500;</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_g"/>(g)     one red packet containing cash of $1,700; and</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_h"/>(h)     one gold chain valued at $2,760.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id=""/>Ng then left Ang’s unit with the items.

He also received a WhatsApp audio message from Ng, where she said that she had taken Ang’s valuables. After Ang informed her that he would call the police if she refused to return his items, she indicated that she would return in 15 minutes; she later said she would return by 6 pm that day. Ang then decided to alert the police. At about 3.19 pm, he called ‘999’ to report the theft.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"/>41     Police officers arrived at Ang’s unit. They assisted to contact Ng on her mobile phone and asked her to return the stolen items to Ang. However, Ng ignored their directions and hung up her phone.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"/>42     (At some point earlier that day) Ng had returned the wallet, identity card, driving licence and POSB ATM card to Ang, by leaving them at the staircase landing near Ang’s unit and informing him about it.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"/>43     As for the other stolen items:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"/>(a)     Ng pawned the gold chain at a MoneyMax pawnshop and obtained cash of $2,386.

Mdm Tay sought a lower sentence for her daughter Ng on account of Ng’s mental illness. Mdm Tay explained that Ng became like that when she was young, and she came from a broken family. Ng’s father was violent towards Mdm Tay because of money problems. Ng saw it and tried to protect her mother, but was hit by her father. In primary and secondary school, Ng was bullied by her classmates and had to seek treatment for her mental illness at IMH. Ng had apologised repeatedly and regretted her wrongdoing. Ng had been locked up in Changi Prison for 5 months and, during this period, she was very frightened and anxious about her sentence. Ng had suicidal thoughts. Mdm Tay urged for a light sentence for Ng so that she could return home soon and she could look for a job. Letters of apology to the victims of Ng’s offences, to which Ng affixed her thumbprint, were enclosed. Two of the victims wrote letters seeking to withdraw their cases against Ng after Ng’s mental problems had been explained to them.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"/>50     Ng also made an oral mitigation plea.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> She said that her father and mother divorced each other when she was in her mother's womb. Her father did not love her. Her mother kept using “big, heavy bamboo pole”, “big, heavy metal chains”, “big, heavy badminton racket” to beat her severely until she became seriously injured. When she went to primary school, her classmates kept bullying her and torturing her. In secondary school, her classmates also bullied and tortured her. When she went to ITE, her ITE classmates used “big, heavy fire matches” to burn her hair, face, hands and legs and all over her body, until her body was seriously injured. They beat her severely with “big, heavy hands”, “big, heavy badminton racket” and “big, heavy storybooks” until her body was seriously injured and very painful. When she went into adulthood, her “sick brain” caused her to do things she did not want to do. She kept hearing hallucinations. Her “sick brain” kept controlling her and causing her to repeat washing her hands and bathing 20 times a day. She felt depressed, stressed, anxious, unhappy. She forgot to take her medication three years ago, and that was why all her “serious mental illness” came back again. In the past few months, the prison officers had reminded her to take medicine on time, so now her serious mental illnesses had gone away and disappeared. She felt remorseful and regretful for the crimes she committed. She promised that from now on she would be a very good girl and behave well; she had turned over a new leaf. She pleaded to the court to be kind and to forgive her and do give her a last and final chance. She asked that her sentence be reduced and backdated (to the date of her remand).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing considerations </p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dominant sentencing consideration: deterrence </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"/>51     In deciding on the sentence, I considered the dominant sentencing consideration to be <em>deterrence</em>. Specific deterrence was particularly relevant considering Ng’s multiple antecedents, which included offences of a similar nature such as theft, breach of protection orders and intentionally causing harassment. There also appeared to have been an escalation in Ng’s offending behaviour. Her latest offences included that of obtaining services dishonestly under s 420A of the Penal Code, which are serious offences punishable with imprisonment for up to 10 years, fine, or both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"/>52     Ng was remanded for a psychiatric evaluation following her arrest on 18 June 2022. The opinion of the consultant psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) who examined Ng was that she had a complex longitudinal clinical history characterized by mood and psychotic episodes (working diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder), features of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and a background of borderline intellectual functioning and likely dysfunctional personality traits. However, no contributory link was established between the diagnosed psychiatric disorders and the offences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, Ng’s psychiatric condition did not diminish her culpability and was not a mitigating factor in sentencing. (That said, Ng would benefit from further psychiatric follow up and treatment for her mental health conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>)</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">Custodial sentences</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"/>53     In my judgement, the sentencing submissions of the prosecution were fair, both in the individual sentences and the global sentence sought.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Theft in dwelling</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"/>54     An offence under s 380 of the Penal Code 1871 is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and the offender is also liable to a fine.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"/>55     The prosecution sought a sentence of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment. It was submitted that the total value of all the stolen items was significant ($5,360). Ng also had recent property-related antecedents:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"/>(a)     On 24 June 2020, Ng was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment for stealing a bottle of mouthwash valued at $3.85 from a store; and 3 weeks’ imprisonment for stealing her mother’s handphone.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"/>(b)     On 1 June 2021, Ng was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for stealing her mother’s mobile phone; and 2 weeks’ imprisonment for stealing two underwear, a bed spread and a blanket from a neighbour’s clothing rack.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"/>56     Weighing these aggravating factors against the mitigating factors (that Ng pleaded guilty and had made partial restitution), it was submitted that a custodial term of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"/>57     I accepted the submission of the prosecution. Considering the significant value of the stolen items and cash, for which full restitution had not been made, and Ng’s past theft offences, I decided that a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for this offence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Criminal trespass</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"/>58     An offence under s 447 of the Penal Code 1871 is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with a fine which may extend to $1,500, or with both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"/>59     In seeking a short custodial term for this offence, the prosecution stated that Ng trespassed into a commercial property (as opposed to a residential property, which would have been more egregious); with the intent to annoy (as opposed to with the intent to commit an offence, which would have been more egregious). Taking into account that fines were ordinarily imposed for criminal trespass into residential property with the intent to annoy, it was submitted that a short custodial term would suffice in the present case.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"/>60     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that a short custodial term would be appropriate. Ng committed the offence of trespass of the premises of Illumia Wheelock after having committed numerous acts of harassment of the staff of the company (at [12]-[18] above), and despite having received a letter from the company’s solicitors expressly banning her from entry into the company’s premises (at [36] above). Her conduct was wilful, and the custodial threshold was crossed. I considered a short imprisonment term of one week to be appropriate, considering that there was no evidence of significant harm being caused by her act of trespass.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3)    <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">Obtaining services dishonestly</span> </p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"/>61     An offence under s 420A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) was punishable (under s 420A(2) of the Act) with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, a fine, or both.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"/>62     For the two charges of obtaining services dishonestly, the prosecution submitted that the harm caused was low. Apart from the fact that the amounts cheated were significant, there were no other factors indicative of high actual or potential harm. Culpability was also low. There was a degree of planning in the manner in which Ng went about committing the offences – she had thought of bringing along a card which would be rejected for payment and using it as an excuse to leave the clinics without making payment – but it was not sophisticated. Apart from the two proceeded charges, there were two TIC charges, and the offences were committed over a period from 6 September to 23 December 2021. No restitution was made. Account was also taken of the fact that Ng pleaded guilty and did not have any cheating-related antecedents.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"/>63     In <em>PP v Abdul Rahman bin A Karim</em> <a class="pagecontent" href="javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25887-SSP.xml')">[2021] SGDC 72</a>, one of the few cases that have been prosecuted under s 420A thus far, the offender was sentenced to <em>32 months’ imprisonment</em> for deceiving a sex worker into believing that he would pay her <em>$1,500</em> for two hours of sexual services. That case, however, had more aggravating factors than the present case and did not provide a helpful reference point in sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"/>64     All in, considering the amounts cheated in the present case in the context of the relatively low harm and low culpability involved, I accepted the submissions of the prosecution that sentences of 4 months’ imprisonment (where the services were valued at $3,167.20) and 6 months’ imprisonment (where the services were valued at $5,103) would be appropriate, with the value of the services dishonestly obtained being a broad proxy for the harm caused.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Making threatening communications</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"/>65     An offence under s 3(1)(b) of the PHA (Cap 256A) was punishable (under s 3(2) of the Act) with a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> As the charge was an amalgamated charge pursuant to s 124(4) of the CPC (Cap 68), the offender may be sentenced to “2 times the amount of punishment” (under s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC (Cap 68)).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"/>66     The prosecution submitted that the threats issued by Ng were particularly vicious. She threatened to defame the clinic and its director not only for lousy services, but also for causing serious health issues and even death to its customers. She made the threats with dogged persistence. Over 19 days, she spam-called Illumia Wheelock’s landline and sent numerous WhatsApp messages, threatening to defame the clinic and its director.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"/>67     Ng had similar antecedents under s 3(1)(b) of the PHA (Cap 256A). On 1 June 2021, she was convicted and sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for sending an email in her (older) sister’s name to her sister’s colleagues, calling her sister a crazy killer murderer; she was also sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment on another charge for posting her sister’s photograph on a Facebook profile with a caption insinuating that her sister had many affairs and was a murderer.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"/>68     The prosecution submitted that in light of the aggravating factors, an uplift from the previous sentences imposed was necessary, and a custodial term of 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate. I accepted the submission of the prosecution. Ng’s persistent harassment of the clinic and its director was egregious and warranted a term of imprisonment. Also, an uplift from the sentences she received previously was appropriate on account of the principle of escalation. I decided that a modest escalation to 6 weeks’ imprisonment would suffice. Despite the persistent harassment by Ng, it did not appear that her acts had caused any particularly serious harm, apart from complaints by the clinic’s customers that their landline was always engaged (at [16] above).</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Failing to comply with EPO</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"/>69     An offence under s 10(1)(b) of the PHA 2014 is punishable with a fine not exceeding $5,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both. As the charge was an amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the CPC 2010, the offender may be sentenced to “2 times the amount of punishment” (under s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC 2010).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"/>70     The prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold had been crossed for this offence. Ng behaved with a blatant disregard for the law. Immediately on the same day of receiving a copy of the EPO from the victim, she embarked on a course of conduct of breaching the order. Her offending was persistent, and she repeatedly breached the EPO on over 28 occasions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"/>71     Ng had antecedents which showed a poor history of lack of compliance with court orders:</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"/>(a)     On 8 January 2015, she was ordered to undergo treatment under a mandatory treatment order (“<b>MTO</b>”) for one year, after pleading guilty to a charge under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter for contravening a Personal Protection Order (“<b>PPO</b>”) which restrained her from using family violence against her mother, by slapping her mother on the back of her head. Four other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing, three of which related to contravening the PPO in relation to her mother.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"/>(b)     On 7 January 2016, Ng was again ordered to undergo treatment under an MTO for one year after pleading guilty to a charge of contravening a PPO by slapping her mother twice, on her left and right cheek. One other charge for contravening the PPO was taken into consideration for sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_c"/>(c)     On 24 June 2020, Ng was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for a charge of contravening a PPO by calling her mother and threatening to stab her, sending a doctored photograph of her mother to her mother’s employer and using vulgarities against her mother. Another charge of contravening a PPO in relation to Ng’s sister was taken into consideration for sentencing.</p> <p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_d"/>(d)     On 1 June 2021, Ng was sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment for a charge of contravening a PPO which restrained her from using family violence against her (older) sister, by posting her sister’s photograph on a Facebook profile with a caption insinuating that her sister had many affairs and was a murderer. Ng was also sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment for another charge of contravening a PPO by making multiple phone calls to her mother, telling her mother to will all her assets to Ng, and that her mother would be knocked down by cars (if she refused to do so).</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"/>72     In light of Ng’s history of poor compliance with court orders, and taking reference from the custodial terms previously imposed on Ng for her offences of contravening protection orders under s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter, the prosecution submitted for a custodial term of 6 to 8 weeks’ imprisonment. I accepted the submission of the prosecution. In my judgement, a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   Consecutive sentences and global sentence</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"/>73     I also accepted the submission of the prosecution that it would be appropriate for the sentences for the theft charge (s 380 Penal Code), the charge of dishonestly obtaining services valued at $5,103 (s 420A Penal Code) and the charge of making threatening communications (s 3(1)(b) PHA (Cap 256A)) to be ordered to run consecutively. These were distinct offences committed against different victims on separate occasions.</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"/>74     The global sentence arrived at was thus 9 months and 6 weeks’ imprisonment. In my judgement, such sentence would be proportionate to the overall culpability of Ng’s offending conduct and the harm caused, and is not a crushing sentence.</p> <p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentence imposed</p> <p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"/>75     In summary, the sentences imposed were as follows:</p> <table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all"
